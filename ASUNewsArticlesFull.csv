Wildfire seasons are getting longer and hotter, threatening forests and the water supplies they protect.

Forest restoration, especially thinning dense stands of trees, can reduce wildfire risk and improve water availability — but measuring the water benefits of forest management has been challenging.

That’s why Arizona State University Professor Enrique Vivoni founded the startup company Tributary. Its mission is to give utilities, governments, nonprofits and companies better tools to measure the real water outcomes of forest restoration projects.

The technical work is complex, but the outcomes are simple.

“Clients don’t want to wade through equations,” Vivoni says. “They want to know: How much water will this project save each year? That’s the translation we provide.”

As the ASU Fulton Professor of Hydrosystems Engineering in the School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment, in the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering, and director of the Center for Hydrologic Innovations, Vivoni has built a career teaching, mentoring and conducting research in hydrology and water resources in arid regions like Arizona.

Tributary grew out of decades of research and a desire to make his expertise useful beyond academia. 

Vivoni teamed up with Zhaocheng Wang, an expert in remote sensing and AI, and Josh Cederstrom, an expert in technology development, and the trio is designing Tributary to bring this science to the market.

“This is a full-scale effort to make a real impact,” Cederstrom says. “We are taking rigorous science and making it usable for water managers and utilities.”

Vivoni’s connection to water and forests began in Puerto Rico. As a scout leader, he camped near a human-made lake surrounded by protected forest.

“That was my entry point to conserving forests for water supply,” he says. “That formative experience led me to pursue college degrees in this field.”

As a graduate student at MIT in the early 2000s, Vivoni imagined starting an environmental tech company. But the dot-com bust convinced him the technology wasn’t quite ready.

Two decades later, new conditions — including generative AI, open-source software, advanced remote sensing and Arizona’s historic investment in water research through the Arizona Water Innovation Initiative that Vivoni is a part of — created a different, market-ready landscape.

“These pivots created the right moment for Tributary to emerge,” he says.

The launch of the Center for Hydrologic Innovations also helped, providing structure for collaboration and linking research to Arizona’s water challenges. Out of this foundation, the idea for Tributary began to take shape.

The push from concept to company came from real-world demand. Utilities like Salt River Project wanted better ways to measure the water benefits of forest thinning.

“That gave us the momentum to launch,” Vivoni says. “Our contribution is to translate peer-reviewed science into outcomes that water managers actually need.”

The focus on user needs is already paying off.

“The innovative work Enrique Vivoni, ASU and Tributary are doing helps SRP understand the watershed benefits of forest thinning,” says Elvy Barton, manager of water and forest sustainability at Salt River Project. “Tributary is providing key watershed metrics and data that allows SRP to clearly articulate the benefits of wildfire resilience and healthy forest projects to our partners.”

Healthy forests act like natural infrastructure: storing and releasing water and reducing wildfire risk. Restoration can improve water supplies, but measuring those benefits has relied on rough estimates that miss the complexity of Arizona’s landscapes.

Tributary changes that. The company uses lidar scans to map forest structure, combining them with data on topography, soils and precipitation to model how thinning trees affects the water cycle.

“Commercial Earth observation has been advancing for decades,” Wang says. “Advances in AI are pushing this further, enabling products like the first-ever global one-meter-resolution forest maps. The combination of high resolution, low latency, high accuracy and low cost makes this ideal for monitoring changes like wildfire and thinning anywhere.”

As innovation director for Tributary, Wang leads the development of new products and helps transfer ASU technology into practical tools by making university-developed research more accessible, faster and cheaper — but just as accurate — for customers.

“A huge part of my role is about tech transfer, and we are lucky to have a lot of support through ASU. I’m working with Skysong, a technology accelerator, to patent methods developed at ASU and bring them into real-world engineering projects,” Wang says.

For Cederstrom, who serves as technical director for Tributary, ASU’s water startup ecosystem made the leap from industry and back to the university possible.

“Between the Arizona Water Innovation Initiative, the Center for Hydrologic Innovations and SkySong, there’s a whole structure to help researchers move ideas into action,” he says.

The name Tributary reflects both hydrology and history. In nature, a tributary is a small stream feeding a larger river, which is an apt metaphor for a startup contributing knowledge to bigger sustainability efforts.

It also nods to Vivoni’s earlier work on the widely used tRIBS hydrologic model, refined by a global research community for more than 20 years and now used as a basis for Tributary's work.

Though based in Arizona, Tributary’s ambitions extend far beyond. The need for healthier forests and smarter water management is global.

“In Arizona,” Vivoni says, “we’re piloting solutions that can scale not only across the western U.S., but for the world.”

That scaling depends on people as much as tools. Vivoni emphasizes the role of students who carry forward the science and skills honed at ASU. Tributary is one successful example of a larger effort at ASU to develop a water technology startup ecosystem in Arizona.

“This is about the human capital we’re developing,” he says. “I’m leading Tributary now, but over time I’ll step back and serve more as an advisor as others take it forward.”

Tributary represents more than a startup story. It’s an example of how universities can export knowledge to the world. For Arizona, it means turning research into practical solutions for water and forest management.

“In a sense, what we’re exporting is knowledge,” Vivoni says. “It’s taking what universities do best— long-term, rigorous science — and making it usable outside the campus walls.”

ASU Clinical Professor Cheryl Schmidt talks about her military service with her Community Health Nursing students in Sands Hall on the West Valley campus. She has been a nurse for 55 years, including a role as a U.S. Army nurse; is an advocate for veterans and nurses to receive recognition and resources; and has been an instructor on disaster preparedness to more than 20,000 nursing students nationwide.

When Cheryl Schmidt was a little girl in rural Ohio, she would watch her mother dress for work —crisp white uniform, nursing cap perched perfectly in place. Her mother had been a nurse and taught cadet nurses during World War II. To young Cheryl, she wasn’t just a caregiver — she was a symbol of dignity and strength.

“I always wanted to be like Mom,” said Schmidt, a clinical professor at Arizona State University’s Edson College of Nursing and Health Innovation. “I said, 'I’m going to be a nurse just like her.'”

That promise became the foundation of a life of service spanning five decades: as a U.S. Army nurse, as an educator shaping generations of students, and as an advocate ensuring veterans and nurses alike receive the recognition and resources they deserve.

On Oct. 24, at age 76, Schmidt was inducted into the Arizona Veterans Hall of Fame, joining 23 others honored for service beyond their military careers. For her, it’s more than a medal. It’s a recognition of a lifetime spent answering the call — whether from the Army, the Red Cross or the nursing students she continues to mentor today at Edson College.

“Dr. Schmidt personifies the highest standards of civic and veteran volunteer spirit expected of nominees for the Arizona Veterans Hall of Fame,” said Lisa Jaurigue, a clinical associate professor at Edson College who nominated Schmidt to the Arizona Veterans Hall of Fame Selection Committee. “As a nurse of 55 years, she continues to serve civilian and veteran communities. In her career thus far, she has been nominated for or awarded 66 awards.”

Schmidt joined the Army in 1974, in the shadow of the Vietnam War. 

“I actually signed up to go to Vietnam,” she said. “But there was a waiting list of nurses. Can you believe that? So I joined the reserves and stayed in.”

It was in the reserves where she built her military career teaching medics, coordinating national disaster drills and eventually rising to lieutenant colonel during Operation Desert Storm. Her family history made service feel inevitable: Her father was in the Army, her brother served in the Navy and her mother was a cadet nurse educator.

But her path almost took a very different turn. As a teenager, Schmidt interviewed to become a nun.

“They asked me if I had ever dated, and I said no because all the nice boys were going steady,” she said, laughing. “The nun told me, ‘Go date for a year and then come back.’ Instead, I went to nursing school. And I never went back.”

From her earliest days in uniform, Schmidt found herself in leadership roles. She already held a master’s degree when she joined, and the Army wasted no time putting her skills to use.

She taught medics for six years, coordinated mock battlefield drills with soldiers covered in fake wounds, and even handled helicopter evacuations using radio codes.

“It was basically leadership from day one,” she said.

When Desert Storm erupted in 1990, Schmidt prepared to deploy overseas with her unit as assistant chief nurse. But an injury while moving heavy boxes left her with permanent back damage. Instead of Saudi Arabia, she was sent to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., where she spent six months running the pediatric unit.

“It was bittersweet,” she admitted. “I had survivor guilt. I didn’t get to Vietnam. I didn’t get to Saudi Arabia. But at Walter Reed, I cared for children of military families from all over the world. I saw diseases I’d only read about in textbooks. It made me a better teacher when I came home.”

Schmidt never stopped teaching. For over 51 years, she has taught at programs in Ohio, Michigan, North Dakota, Arkansas and now Arizona. Her specialty became community health and disaster nursing. These are fields that many students initially overlook but that she makes come alive with real-world stories.

“I tell my students, ‘You may want ICU glory, but if you send a patient home without proper support, and they’re readmitted within 30 days, Medicare won’t pay,’” she says. “That gets their attention.”

Her philosophy is rooted in action. Schmidt was living in Arkansas when the state took in 70,000 evacuees after Hurricane Katrina. Only five nurses in the state were trained in Red Cross disaster shelters. Schmidt trained 180 more almost overnight, then began integrating disaster preparedness into nursing curricula nationwide.

Since 2009, she estimates she has trained more than 20,000 nursing students in disaster response.

“You have to be able to think on the fly,” she said. “Sometimes you have no resources. You just show up, and there you are.”

Schmidt’s advocacy doesn’t end with nursing. As a disabled veteran herself, she has fought to make sure others like her get the care and recognition they deserve. She currently serves on the American Academy of Nursing’s Expert Panel on Military and Veterans Health, where she helped launch the national campaign “Have You Ever Served?”, which encourages health care providers to ask patients about military service so they can better diagnose and treat conditions linked to exposures such as Agent Orange and burn pits.

She also champions recognition for those who have been overlooked, especially nurses. More recently, Schmidt has been lobbying Congress to award World War II nurses the Congressional Gold Medal. Many, she points out, stayed behind during the Bataan Death March in the Philippines, choosing to care for soldiers even at the cost of their lives.

“Nobody recognizes them,” she says. “And yet they gave everything.”

As a woman in uniform, Schmidt also saw firsthand the challenges that women veterans continue to face, from harassment to systemic underestimation. She recalls turning down unwanted advances from commanders and fellow soldiers alike.

“A lot of women weren’t so lucky,” Schmidt said.

Her doctoral work examined women’s roles in the military. Her conclusion is that service should be based on physical ability, not gender. Women, she argues, bring strengths from communications to leadership that are just as vital as physical muscle.

“As a nurse educator, Cheryl has spent the last five decades sharing her immense knowledge and experience and has inspired thousands of nurses,” said Wanda Wright, director of ASU’s Office for Veteran and Military Academic Engagement. “Her service to veterans both as an Army veteran herself and through disaster and public health initiatives reminds us how important the profession of care can be.”

If there is a single thread through Schmidt’s life, it is mentorship. She takes special pride in lifting up young nurses. People like Elizabeth Wakefield, the ASU student she guided from a first-term novice to state president of the Student Nurses’ Association of Arizona, now winning national awards.

“My mantra is, 'You’re not a professional nurse unless you belong to a professional organization,'” Schmidt said. “Otherwise, you’re just a clock-puncher. Leadership matters.”

Even today, she brings that philosophy into the classroom, telling stories that blend military precision with human compassion. Her students, she notes, consistently give her top ratings not because the coursework is easy, but because she makes it matter.

“Dr. Schmidt has played a pivotal role in shaping not only my education but also my professional and personal growth,"" Wakefield said. ""She has taught me to persevere through the challenges of nursing school, to pursue leadership roles and to seize opportunities for growth, such as presenting at national conventions, publishing, volunteering in the community and building disaster-preparedness skills. 

“She leads by example, showing up with a smile, dedicating herself to service and encouraging every student to achieve more than they thought was possible. … Personally, I can say with certainty that I would not be the nursing leader I am today without Dr. Schmidt’s mentorship.”

I’ve always felt proud to be an Army nurse. And if my story can help others, then it’s worth telling.

Perhaps Schmidt’s drive comes from a moment when she almost lost everything. As a nursing student, she underwent surgery for a bowel tumor and nearly died from infection.

“I was in the corner of the room, looking down at my body,” she recalled. “I thought, ‘Oh, that’s me down there.’ It wasn’t scary. It didn’t hurt. It was actually kind of peaceful.”

Schmidt survived, but the experience left her determined never to waste the time she was given.

“Life is a gift,” she said.

For decades, Schmidt poured herself into her work with little thought of recognition. That’s why this year’s induction into the Arizona Veterans Hall of Fame feels so special.

“This is the first state I’ve lived in that honors veterans this way,” Schmidt said. “I never even knew it existed until a colleague told me to apply. To be chosen is humbling.”

“Our WAC-Army Women United Chapter 68 was pleased to have Dr. Schmidt join us,"" said Gabe Forsberg, corresponding secretary for the WAC – Army Women United. ""Her dedication to her profession and military service was exemplary and exactly the kind of person who deserves to be honored by the Arizona Veterans Hall of Fame. 

""Cheryl is always thinking of ways to help veterans, and has the unique skills and contacts to bring about positive change. We are delighted to call her our Army sister, and she serves as a true inspiration.”

True to form, Schmidt doesn’t see the honor as hers alone. She sees it as another platform and a way to elevate the work of nurses, veterans and students.

“I’ve always felt proud to be an Army nurse,” she said. “And if my story can help others, then it’s worth telling.”

A team of Arizona State University researchers, including faculty members in the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at ASU, is developing innovative robotics and systems powered by artificial intelligence, or AI, for fuel pipeline inspections. The systems will allow infrastructure experts to access pipelines once considered impossible to inspect, enabling safety checks that are long overdue. Image courtesy of whitestorm/Adobe Stock and generated using AI

They run beneath our feet, unseen but essential. Millions of miles of pipeline carry the natural gas, crude oil and refined fuels that keep modern life running. Yet as this buried infrastructure ages, cracks, leaks and ruptures are becoming alarmingly common.

From 2002 to 2021, pipeline incidents in the U.S. caused 276 deaths, more than 1,100 injuries and $10 billion in damage. With roughly 650 serious incidents each year, the need for safer, smarter pipeline inspection technology has never been clearer.

Despite the risks, many pipelines go years without a thorough inspection. Some can’t be inspected at all. Known as unpiggable pipelines, these sections twist through narrow turns, outdated valves and complex connections that standard inspection tools simply can’t navigate. The result is a costly blind spot for one of the nation’s most critical systems.

Arizona State University researchers are working to change that. Supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation, their project is creating a new generation of innovative robotic systems and artificial intelligence, or AI, models designed to make pipeline inspection faster, safer and more reliable than ever before.

Leading the effort is Wenlong Zhang, an associate professor of manufacturing engineering in the School of Manufacturing Systems and Networks, part of the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at ASU. As principal investigator, Zhang oversees the project’s development and leads the creation of a new class of soft, flexible inspection robots capable of navigating pipes that traditional tools can’t reach.

“Pipelines can be inspected using in-line tools with magnetic flux leakage and ultrasonic waves,” Zhang says. “However, due to the complex geometries of pipelines, over- or undersized valves, small-radius bends and other challenges, many critical segments of the 2.6 million miles of pipeline in the U.S. are uninspected.”

His team’s solution is an autonomous, soft robot inspired by inchworms, composed of inflatable fabric actuators allowing it to grip, stretch and move through narrow, twisting pipes. The robot can carry lightweight sensors to detect cracks and corrosion while adapting its body to the pipeline’s shape.

“This project will allow us to significantly improve the efficiency, endurance and autonomy level of future in-pipe robots,” Zhang says.

But the impact goes beyond robotics. Zhang sees the technology as a model for how intelligent robotics can transform aging infrastructure.

While Zhang’s robots collect data, Yongming Liu, a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering in the School for Engineering of Matter, Transport and Energy, part of the Fulton Schools, is working to predict what that data means. His focus is on understanding how pipelines fail in real-world conditions and anticipating problems before they occur.

By blending theory and machine learning, Liu’s team is creating a predictive framework that helps utilities see problems coming long before they become dangerous. His models can estimate a pipeline’s remaining lifespan under complex conditions pipelines face daily — where pressure, corrosion and environmental factors constantly fluctuate — to offer a smarter, more proactive approach to maintenance and safety.

“Energy infrastructure safety is fundamental to both the economy and public well-being,” Liu says. “Many of these systems are aging, and understanding how to extend their lives safely is a grand scientific and societal challenge.”

At the heart of the project’s data intelligence is Hao Yan, an associate professor of industrial engineering in the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence, part of the Fulton Schools. Yan and his team are developing a new kind of AI that doesn’t just predict when something might go wrong. It also explains why.

The team’s system fuses information from multiple sources, including real-time sensor data from inside the pipes, detailed physics simulations and decades of written accident reports. By integrating all of these perspectives, the AI can identify subtle patterns and emerging risks that would be invisible to any single data source.

Unlike traditional black box algorithms, Yan’s framework emphasizes transparency and trust. It not only makes predictions but also measures how confident it is in those predictions, grounding each decision in physics and engineering knowledge. The result is an intelligent system that engineers can interpret, regulators can trust and operators can use to act before small problems become major failures.

Ultimately, Yan envisions a future where utility operators receive early, data-driven warnings before a failure occurs.

“By teaching AI to read and learn from decades of pipeline accident reports, we can uncover recurring human, environmental and mechanical risk factors that traditional models overlook,” Yan says. “These insights can give utilities early warnings about potential failures, protecting people’s safety and minimizing costly service disruptions.”

To ensure the project’s technologies make sense in the real world, Hanna Breetz, an associate professor in ASU’s School of Sustainability, is leading the project’s stakeholder engagement and policy analysis. Her work bridges the gap between engineering innovation and the complex regulatory and political environment surrounding energy infrastructure.

Breetz’s team is interviewing policymakers, industry leaders and public interest groups to identify emerging safety codes and monitoring standards. Their insights will guide how the engineering team designs technology that meets regulatory needs while being practical to adopt. As the project progresses, Breetz will also help translate its findings into publications and outreach materials for industry and government leaders.

What makes this project especially distinctive is its interdisciplinary nature. Zhang, Liu, Yan and Breetz are blending expertise from robotics, materials science, AI and policy studies — disciplines that rarely meet but are all essential for reimagining infrastructure management.

The team is also working with collaborators at Michigan State University and GTI Energy, an energy transition technology company, which will host field demonstrations at its Illinois test site. There, the robots and AI systems will be tested under realistic conditions and industry experts will provide feedback to refine the tools before real-world deployment.

The researchers hope their work will pave the way for a new generation of intelligent infrastructure systems, ones that can monitor themselves, predict problems early and help engineers make data-informed maintenance decisions.

As Liu puts it, “This project will demonstrate that proactive, data-informed safety management is possible on a national scale.”

And while the technologies emerging from this highly interdisciplinary collaboration may one day protect the pipelines beneath our feet, their true impact could reach even further by transforming how we use robotics and AI to care for the infrastructure that sustains modern life.

When Mariana Torres first stepped onto the campus of Arizona State University, she was stepping into uncharted territory — not just for herself but for her entire family. A first-generation Latina and the first in her family born in the U.S., Torres admits she felt completely lost at first.

“I didn’t know how to get an internship, how to network or even what it meant to navigate college,” she said. “Everything was overwhelming, exciting, intimidating, unfamiliar.”

Fast-forward to today, and Torres, a W. P. Carey School of Business student, has not only found her footing but she’s thriving — a long list of scholar awards, volunteer work, and internships with Walmart and Google. She has also analyzed data for companies like Intel, Netflix and The Grammys. 

She credits ASU with helping her open doors to new career opportunities. And a global network of top employers and organization agrees.

The newest Global Employability University Ranking and Survey, or GEURS, again ranked ASU second among public U.S. universities for employable graduates — ahead of UCLA, the University of Michigan and Purdue. Among all U.S. institutions, ASU was ranked No. 14. Globally, the university is ranked No. 37, up from No. 41 last year, ahead of the University of Melbourne, LMU Munich and King’s College London.

“Our graduates are entering a workforce that values creativity, resilience and adaptability — skills that are relevant to all jobs and industries,” said Nancy Gonzales, ASU executive vice president and university provost. “At ASU, we are intentional about helping students build durable and AI-proof competencies through every part of their academic experience. This recognition reinforces that employers see ASU graduates as ready to take on complex challenges and lead change in their fields.”

GEURS stands out as the only ranking shaped entirely by the perspectives of international employers. First introduced in 2010, it is developed by Emerging, a leading consulting and polling institute, and published by Times Higher Education. Today, GEURS is recognized as the most trusted global benchmark for assessing graduate employability.

Each year, GEURS highlights the top 250 universities worldwide for producing career-ready graduates. The 2026 survey reveals a growing demand among employers for candidates who combine strong digital literacy with deep subject expertise. These skills are increasingly seen as essential for success in a rapidly evolving workforce.

This commitment aligns with the university’s focus on sustainability, engineering, data analytics, health care and digital media — areas that currently reflect current industry demands and address evolving global challenges. Employers consistently recognize ASU graduates for their ability to combine technical expertise with a global perspective and a commitment to lifelong learning.

Among the top employers of ASU graduates this year are Amazon, Intel, Banner Health, Deloitte, Honeywell, Boeing, Charles Schwab, PepsiCo, Honor Health and the federal government, according to ASU Career Services.

Joanne Vogel, vice president of student services with Educational Outreach and Student Services, emphasized that ASU’s strength lies in preparing students to meet the demands of a rapidly changing workforce.

“This ranking reflects ASU’s unparalleled support for students as they navigate their career journey,” Vogel said. “Beginning at first contact with students and continuing through graduation and beyond, we emphasize the importance of taking advantage of ASU’s broad range of resources whether in person or online.”

Vogel added that ASU students have access to state-of-the-art digital tools for career exploration, job market insights, resume review, interview preparation and credentialing, and they can participate in career fairs, faculty research, mentoring, student clubs focused on networking and career advancement, and internship opportunities.

“We strongly encourage students to engage in an internship to clarify their career aspirations and because employers are more likely to hire students with prior experience quicker and with higher pay,” Vogel said. “We are glad that employers worldwide agree that our students are well prepared for the next phase of their lives and add tremendous value to their companies.”

One of the high-achieving students Vogel mentors is Sedra Shahin, a Barrett, The Honors College student who is on track to graduate in May 2026 with an impressive trio of degrees: business administration, business law, and public service and public policy.

A first-generation student born in Syria, Shahin grew up speaking Arabic. She moved to the U.S. at the age of 12, bringing with her resilience and determination that would define her college career.

While at ASU, Shahin immersed herself in internships that shaped her understanding of law, public service and business. At the League of Arizona Cities and Towns, she gained exposure to policy work and legal counsel, inspiring her business law focus. Her role as student body president provided firsthand experience in public service, and her internship at Wells Fargo introduced her to compliance and corporate ethics.

“Every major has a story,” she said, “and every experience shaped me into who I am today.”

Balancing academics with internships and leadership roles, Shahin also carved out time to plan for her future. She has secured a full-time position with Wells Fargo as a control management analyst, which she describes as “an insane relief” amid the pressures her peers face in the job search. Even with a busy schedule, she is already contemplating graduate school, considering either a master’s degree in legal studies or public administration.

ASU faculty and staff say helping students connect their education to meaningful work has always been a core part of what they do.

“At the College of Global Futures, we’re focused on making sure students graduate with the hard skills employers need today — data literacy, systems thinking and collaborative problem-solving — while also preparing them to lead in the careers that are just beginning to take shape,” said Kate Eaton, associate dean for students and academic innovation for the Rob Walton College of Global Futures. “Whether they’re advancing sustainable energy solutions, shaping ethical uses of AI or designing more resilient communities, we want our students to have the tools and confidence to make an impact now and to adapt as the world continues to evolve.”

Detra Montoya said she spends a significant about of her time helping students prepare for successful careers by connecting them directly with industry professionals.

“I actively forge relationships with companies to create meaningful opportunities for students, from inviting guest speakers and facilitating live company projects to organizing career fairs and sales competitions where students can showcase their skills and network with potential employers,” said Montoya, a clinical professor in the Department of Marketing at the W. P. Carey School of Business.

In addition to matching students with employers, Montoya said her department is dedicated to preparing students for the job market through soft skill development and by providing networking opportunities with industry professionals.

“I truly value working at a university that prioritizes career readiness and supports our efforts to prepare students for success beyond graduation,” Montoya said.

Recent headlines warn of cooling tech job postings and lower starting salaries, and stories are rife with fears that artificial intelligence, or AI, will eliminate entry-level roles. 

For students considering a degree in computer science or software engineering, the news can sound discouraging.

Computer scientists in the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at Arizona State University say the reality is more nuanced, complex and hopeful. 

They point out that although tools and platforms evolve, the core skills of computer science remain valuable across industries. Those foundations have already survived major technological shifts, becoming more essential as industries adapted to new challenges.

Question: Is AI eliminating computer science jobs?

Maciejewski: Current reports don’t show a sweeping “AI effect.” Some studies suggest today’s slowdown could be the result of post-pandemic over-hiring. What’s definitely happening is a shift in how jobs are done. AI copilots can draft code, but that makes quality assurance, integration and systems thinking more important. Students who master those fundamentals can thrive.

Bliss: Computer science foundations, including abilities like problem-solving, abstraction and algorithmic thinking, don’t go out of style. Programming languages change, but core skills endure. My mantra is simple: Do more math. It makes you precise about assumptions and limitations, which is crucial in an AI-driven world.

Bansal: In software engineering, most effort is already in testing, debugging and maintenance. As Ross noted, AI can generate starter code, but students must still validate, integrate and secure it. Critical thinking and deep technical knowledge are more important than ever.

Q: What historical patterns should students keep in mind?

Maciejewski: Tech hiring has often been quite cyclical. The early ’90s, the 2001 dot-com crash and the 2008 recession all brought contractions, but the field rebounded with new platforms and opportunities. Students entering school today will likely graduate into a market that has absorbed AI more thoughtfully, with a continued demand for engineers who can design and scale trustworthy systems.

Bliss: Each major wave of technology, from parallel computing to internet commerce, reshaped the job market, but instead of eliminating roles, it created new and different ones. With every expansion, more fields became dependent on computer science expertise, multiplying opportunities rather than reducing them.

Bansal: We’ve seen similar cycles with software tools. In the 1980s, it was reusable code libraries, then open-source frameworks and later integrated development environments that eased syntax and debugging. Each time, people worried jobs might disappear. Instead, productivity increased, and engineers moved on to tackle bigger, more complex projects, like web and mobile apps in the 2000s. AI is the next wave in that same pattern. But it doesn’t eliminate the need for software engineers. It pushes them to higher levels of problem-solving.

Every industry is now a tech industry. No matter where you go, companies need people who can design, secure and maintain complex computer systems.

Q: Where is job demand strongest right now?

Maciejewski: Students with AI expertise are in demand, but shortages are also acute in cybersecurity and microelectronics. Globally, millions more cybersecurity professionals are needed, and the U.S. semiconductor industry alone may require nearly half a million additional workers by 2030. In the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence, every undergraduate takes a cybersecurity course, and we offer concentrations to prepare computer science students for these roles.

Bliss: In ASU’s Global Security Initiative, we’re also applying AI in mission-critical settings like defense and infrastructure. That’s where students learn both capability and responsibility: how AI can help, where it can fail and how to design around its limitations.

Q: How is ASU preparing students for an AI-enabled future?

Maciejewski: ASU ranks among the top programs nationally in AI education. Students take courses in robotics, machine learning and autonomous systems, but they can also gain applied experience through internships and research that connect AI to real-world challenges. The School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence is also the home of globally recognized faculty members such as data mining trailblazer Huan Liu and Subbarao Kambhampati, a past president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence and winner of the organization’s 2025 Patrick Henry Winston Outstanding Educator Award. We believe students have a real opportunity to engage with AI thought leaders here in the school.

Bansal: In software engineering, we focus on durable core skills like systems design, collaboration and resilience. Our capstone program is especially powerful. Industry sponsors bring real problems, and students carry projects from requirements through design, coding and testing. Increasingly, these projects are AI-enabled, involving recommendation engines, natural language processing or predictive analytics.

That means students practice treating AI as a tool, not a replacement. They learn to use it for code scaffolding or testing, but also to critique outputs, debug errors and integrate results into larger systems. Employers tell us this fluency, the ability to use AI while maintaining engineering rigor, is exactly what they need.

Bliss: That aligns with the results of the most recent Practitioner-to-Professor Survey from the CRA, where we asked industry experts to tell us what they were seeing out in the workplace. The feedback emphasized broad-based AI literacy, lifelong learning and cross-sector collaboration. ASU is built for that approach.

Q: What skills matter most to employers?

Bliss: Problem-solving, systems thinking, experimentation and communication. Programming languages change, but fundamentals don’t. Employers also want teamwork, good soft skills and adaptability. These are things that can matter even more when you’re working alongside AI.

Maciejewski: That’s why we encourage students to go beyond the classroom. Through research programs, service work and interdisciplinary projects, they practice leadership and collaboration. Employers increasingly ask, “What have you built? How did you work on a team? How did you test your system?”

Bansal: Capstone projects prepare students for exactly those questions. They practice client consultation, project management and public presentation, explaining technical decisions to both engineers and nontechnical stakeholders. By graduation, they’ve already delivered solutions to real clients, many involving AI, which shows employers they can apply skills in practice.

Q: What about advanced degrees?

Bliss: The CRA worries that the U.S. risks losing its leadership position in fields like AI, cybersecurity and quantum computing because fewer domestic students are pursuing PhDs. Yet doctoral research powers innovation, industry growth and national security. Sustaining that pipeline requires partnerships. We need federal investment, as well as industry support, since most doctoral students ultimately go on to companies where they create new products, launch sectors and drive competitiveness. Advanced study also equips students to take on entirely new problems that simply can’t be addressed without deeper training.

Maciejewski: For undergraduates, it’s natural to weigh immediate salaries against years of study. But advanced research puts you at the frontier, working on problems that can launch startups or reshape industries. At ASU, students also have opportunities to pursue accelerated master’s degrees, allowing them to deepen their expertise without adding many extra years of study. A graduate degree can open doors to more specialized roles and leadership positions in the workforce. A PhD isn’t for everyone, but for those who pursue it, the payoff comes not just in credentials but in the chance to create entirely new opportunities for themselves and others.

The road ahead contains both great challenges and great opportunities. This is a moment for us to lead.

Q: What final advice would you give students?

Bansal: Approach your education with agility. Tools and platforms will keep changing, but what lasts are the habits you develop — learning how to learn, sticking with things that don’t initially work and collaborating effectively. Those habits will allow you to grow into new opportunities as they appear.

Maciejewski: When I graduated in 2001, the dot-com bubble had just burst and the job market looked bleak. What I learned is that cycles come and go, but the people who invest in key skills and stay adaptable are the ones who succeed over time. Don’t measure your future only by today’s headlines. Focus on building the kind of resilience and expertise that will carry you through shifts in technology and the economy alike.

Bliss: What excites me is that entirely new classes of challenges are emerging, and they create opportunities for computer scientists at every level. We’re grappling with the energy demands of large-scale computing and the need for low-power architectures. We’re exploring the intersections of AI with quantum computing and biotechnology. These are open problems, and they’re consequential ones. For students, that means there is enormous room to contribute and innovate. The future isn’t about fewer opportunities. It’s about different, more complex opportunities that require the kind of deep training college degrees can provide.

When Arizona State University student Makaela Ross reports to work each day, 35 pairs of wide, black eyes are waiting.

“It’s like working with 35 toddlers,” Ross said, laughing as she describes her days at OdySea Aquarium in Scottsdale, Arizona. But these “toddlers” have feathers, waddle across the floor and one in particular brays like a donkey when she crouches to greet her.

Ross, an undergraduate transfer student studying neuroscience with a minor in psychology in ASU’s Department of Psychology, part of The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, began an animal care internship at OdySea in summer 2024. Before her internship ended, she was offered and accepted a full-time position as an animal care specialist for the aquarium’s colony of African penguins — a species now classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

With fewer than 20,000 mature adults left to repopulate, African penguins are just one step away from extinction. Climate change, overfishing and habitat loss are all driving their decline, said Jessica Peranteau, OdySea’s director of animal care and education. The aquarium participates in the African Penguin Species Survival Plan with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, or AZA, which works with other AZA-accredited institutions worldwide to conserve the species.

Through careful observation and positive reinforcement training, Ross and the care team keep the colony healthy.

Ross switched majors several times before finding her fit in neuroscience. And while she had always loved penguins, she never imagined working with them.

She and her husband frequently visited OdySea, where her enthusiasm for the animals caught the attention of the aquarium’s education team. They encouraged her to apply for the internship program. Although she worried her neuroscience background might not measure up to applicants from biology or pre-vet programs, two professors wrote her letters of recommendation and she earned the position.

Shannon Eaton, assistant teaching professor in the Department of Psychology, said Ross stands out for her drive to connect coursework to a deeper understanding.

“She always wants to understand the bigger picture,” Eaton said. “In her mind, she doesn’t need to get the best grade — she just needs to understand, and that’s a joy to have in class.”

Her supervisors at OdySea noticed the same qualities. Peranteau said Ross was the first neuroscience student accepted into the program and praised her ability to connect small observations to larger patterns of behavior.

Curator of animal care and education Mary Mills Seader added that Ross quickly set herself apart by “asking the right questions” and stepping outside her comfort zone to learn more.

At OdySea, Ross uses concepts from her neuroscience of learning coursework, including operant conditioning, to train and monitor the penguins. Operant conditioning — rewarding a specific behavior so it’s more likely to happen again — is a core part of how the team keeps the colony engaged and thriving.

She collaborates with other OdySea animal care specialists and the aquarium's animal health team to track changes in the penguins’ health and behavior, from eating patterns to how they walk. 

Ross said each penguin has a unique personality and motivators — some prefer food, others thrive on social interactions with their fellow penguins. Her neuroscience training helps her identify these reinforcers and adjust care accordingly.

Eaton noted that neuroscience is inherently interdisciplinary, asking wide-ranging questions about memory, attention, motivation and emotion. That perspective, she said, gives Ross an advantage in understanding the colony at a deeper level.

“Neuroscience provides a biological foundation for animal behavior and for the psychological phenomena that is learning and motivation,” Peranteau said. “That’s where her background plays into it really well.”

Ross said her journey shows how neuroscience can be applied in unexpected ways, even to caring for an endangered species.

She is set to graduate in spring 2026, but for now she hopes her work contributes to the survival of African penguins. Beyond animal care, she also educates aquarium guests on the species’ decline and the role people can play in protecting them.

“Our work matters because African penguins and all of the animals on the planet play a critical role in our environment,” Ross said.

The internship program at OdySea Aquarium runs during the fall, spring and summer semesters. Positions range from animal care to guest relations to human resources. Applicants must be currently enrolled in school or within one year of graduation. The spring 2026 program will begin accepting applications on Nov. 1.

Whether retired from the military or on active duty, Arizona State University has a steadfast commitment to provide military-affiliated students with different ways to access a college degree, provide them with a supportive environment and help them succeed inside and outside of the classroom.

Through ASU Online, military-affiliated students have found the flexibility to continue serving while pursuing a degree and accessing ASU's resources and world-class faculty, regardless of their location.

The Pat Tillman Veterans Center at ASU was established to support students and families who have served our country, helping them succeed on their college journey and preparing them for life after they graduate.

“Our center really exists to provide customer service excellence, community and career readiness for our over 21,000 military-connected learners,” said Shawn Banzhaf, executive director of the Pat Tillman Veterans Center. “We do this because we know the path to a degree and career is full of obstacles and we want to smooth as much of that path as possible here at ASU.”

The center’s team includes veterans, current military personnel, dependent family members and others connected to the military or veteran experience who pride themselves in being in the service of others and helping service members, military veterans and their families navigate the college experience.

During ASU’s Salute to Service week, we spoke with active-duty personnel and veterans about their experience at ASU Online and what serving their country means to them.  

Army National Guard | Shaftesbury, Vermont

Army veteran Andrew Hunt has dedicated years of service to his fellow veterans through volunteerism and fellowship.

Hunt spent the majority of his career in various law enforcement roles, while also serving in the Army, where he deployed to Iraq for a year and a half.

The military was also a path towards a college degree. What he didn’t expect was how his military experience would shape the college experience for enlisted service members and military veterans.

Outside of work and family, he dedicated his time to volunteering and running a veteran organization.

“I get a lot of joy of helping my fellow veterans and working to assist them, either through the programming that I was doing, which was facilitating outdoor opportunities for veterans to go on hunting trips, fishing trips, hiking and camping,” Hunt said.

While working as a safety patrol supervisor at a university in Vermont, the dean’s office, aware of his nonprofit work supporting veterans, approached him for guidance on how to better serve military-affiliated students.

“Military members and veterans range from 24 years old up to 45 years old,” Hunt said. “I help people understand the nuances of veteran students, the transition from military life to civilian life.” 

Hunt bridges the gap between students who have served and college staff, helping them translate military acronyms or explain how to read deployment orders to better support students through their college experience.

He also helps develop veteran programming and raise awareness about veteran issues on campus, like mental health.

After earning his associate degree and taking a small break, Hunt is also pursuing his own degree through ASU Online and says ASU already feels like home.

“The applied military and veteran studies degree not only seemed fitting, but was the first undergraduate degree that I was actually excited about when I discovered it as an option,” he said. “I am already currently involved in the relevant work and feel that this degree would not only benefit me, but the veterans that I currently serve and those I will serve in the future.”  

United States Air Force | Agat, Guam

In Guam, nearly every family has at least one member or friend who has served or is currently serving in the United States military.

For Rheanna Juanillo, growing up in that environment meant she always saw military service not only as a way to serve her country and island but also as an opportunity to travel, earn a degree and build a stable career.

Juanillo enrolled at the University in Guam, but soon felt that there were more opportunities to explore and decided to enlist in the Air Force.

It was during her temporary duty station in Yuma, Arizona, that she learned about ASU and the military tuition assistance benefit.

The support that ASU provides military students and the network Juanillo has been able to build cemented for her that she made the right choice.

After graduating with her bachelor’s degree in business administration, she decided to continue her studies with ASU Online and enrolled in the Master of Legal Studies program.

“Earning this degree is part of my long-term plan for stability and purpose after completing my military service,” she said. “It’s about preparing for a meaningful transition into federal service in legal compliance, where I can continue to serve with integrity and impact. This degree gives me the tools and confidence to step into that next chapter with clarity and security.”

From academic advising to career resources to the team at the Pat Tillman Veteran Center, the center was instrumental in helping her transition from an undergraduate to a graduate degree.

“The Pat Tillman Center has been extremely helpful,” Juanillo said. “When I decided to get my master's, I had to use my GI Bill on top of my military tuition assistance to cover the costs. So they've been very communicative with the transition and information that I needed to ensure that I receive my benefits.”

Currently stationed in Colorado, the ASU Alumni Association enabled her to find community wherever she’s stationed.

“There's a great ASU alumni (chapter) here in Colorado,” she said. “They do a lot of alumni events as well as the Pat Tillman Honor Run here, so I try to be involved as much as I can.”

Throughout her experience, she felt like she was part of a community that understood the unique challenges of working professionals, and specifically military service members.

But the most significant moments of her career have been those in which she was able to serve in ways that transcend duty.

“Humanitarian missions, in particular, have reminded me of the deeper purpose behind my uniform, the chance to uplift others in moments of vulnerability and need,” Juanillo said. “Whether offering aid to communities in crisis or standing beside those who have lost everything, these experiences reaffirm why I chose this path: to be a force for compassion, resilience and hope.

Nevada Air National Guard | Reno, Nevada

Nevada Air National Guard Col. Jen Kimsey wants female military members to know the sky is the limit.

Her father and grandfather served in the Navy, and with college out of reach, she followed in their footsteps with one piece of advice from her dad: Join the Air Force.

Leading airmen, being a mentor and setting an example to other female military members of what is possible were the most rewarding aspects of her job.

“I try to teach females, whether they're enlisted or officers, whatever age or rank that they are, that you can move forward,” Kimsey said. “But you can't move forward without your education.”

Earning her degree opened opportunities for her, including the chance to be promoted.

“When I retired, I am proud to say I was only one of two female colonels in the Nevada Air National Guard,” she said. “Without my degree, I never would have been able to have that opportunity.”

While Kimsey earned her hygienist degree in person, her schedule didn’t allow for an in-person master's degree, and everything about ASU was what she needed to earn her degree while also working full time, raising a family and fulfilling her military obligation.

A partnership between ASU and Air University allowed her to enroll in a Graduate Professional Military Education program, where she earned her master’s degree in military operational art and science.

This partnership transitioned the Air University eSchool of Graduate Professional Military Education programs and curriculum to ASU’s innovative learning environment, providing the air and space forces a world-class online, adaptive learning environment to deliver its professional development programs.

Between volleyball tournaments for her daughter and a deployment, she credits ASU for its flexible schedule and support for military members and veterans.

“I was able to work on my degree while deployed to another country and on a completely different time zone,” Kimsey said. “They (ASU employees) want you to be successful and will help you along the way.”

After 31 years of service, she medically retired in 2025, feeling accomplished by the example she set for her children, the career she led and the impact she made.

“I'm very proud of our country,” Kimsey said. “I'm very community-based, and so for me, being able to wear the uniform and the pride associated with that, it’s a feeling of doing something different, that I’m adding value to my community and my country.”

United States Marines | Tracy, California

Marine Corps veteran Roberto Perez comes from a long line of veterans, following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather.

Perez found the greatest reward of military service wasn’t just the discipline or the ability to stay calm under pressure. It was the people.

Through years of service, he learned the true meaning of leadership: leading by example, serving others and building unbreakable bonds. When he finished his service, he applied his military skills to his new career.

Perez also realized he needed a degree to grow professionally.

He enrolled in the undergraduate business administration degree program offered online at ASU, growing his skill set as a more well-versed leader and strategic thinker who can communicate effectively and bring real value to his team and organization.

“Studying business is helping me grow in those areas so I can continue to make a positive impact in my career,” Perez said. “Working full time, the online format allowed me to continue my education without stepping away from my career, and I’ve still felt very connected to the ASU community.”

Perez wanted a university that supported veterans and working students, and with ASU’s reputation for innovation, online learning flexibility and strong support from the Pat Tillman Veterans Center, he knew he’d found the right place to earn his degree.

“The most rewarding part of my military service was learning how to lead by example and serve others,” Perez said. “Earning my degree will open new doors for my career and help me grow as a leader. Personally, it’s something I’m very proud of, and I hope it inspires others to keep going after their goals, no matter how busy life gets.”

Arizona’s public employees keep the state moving — maintaining infrastructure, supporting families and serving communities. 

Through a new initiative from Arizona State University and the state of Arizona, these employees have the opportunity to strengthen key skills and apply them in service to their communities.

This statewide initiative brings together a broad portfolio of professional learning offerings developed by ASU’s schools and colleges — spanning business, data analytics and visualization, collaboration, leadership and more — to meet the evolving needs of Arizona’s workforce. 

The collaboration was created in response to employee engagement survey feedback that professional learning and development ranked among employees’ top priorities. Data also showed that employer-paid certifications are among the most valued workplace benefits, evidence that continued learning builds both satisfaction and performance in the workplace.

Due to its strong alignment with the needs of Arizona state employees, the program reached capacity just two weeks after launch. More than 1,000 employees expressed interest, and 600 have already enrolled. Additional enrollment will be offered as more space or funding becomes available.

In collaboration with their supervisors, employees were able to choose what fits their goals, such as a short course to sharpen computer application skills or a longer certificate that builds leadership, data and technology expertise. Every option is flexible, practical and available to eligible employees at no cost.

“Arizona’s state employees are the heart of public service. This partnership invests in them — helping our workforce strengthen its skills, stay adaptable and continue delivering the best possible service to the people of Arizona,” Gov. Katie Hobbs said. “The incredible demand for the program shows how much state employees value high-quality professional development and the opportunity to earn a credential, which will generate a strong return on investment for the state.”

Across industries, work is being reshaped by new technologies, automation and artificial intelligence. 

According to the World Economic Forum’s 2025 ""Future of Jobs Report,"" nearly 40% of job skills will change within the next five years, while more than 170 million new roles will emerge globally as others evolve or disappear.

Arizona’s public agencies are navigating that same transformation. The ASU-Arizona partnership provides a structured, accessible way for employees to build digital fluency, strengthen leadership and enhance problem-solving skills relevant to their roles in government.

ASU, ranked No. 1 in the nation for innovation by U.S. News & World Report for 11 consecutive years, already has supported more than 1 million learners worldwide through its continuing and professional learning programs. 

A leader in workforce development, the newest Global Employability University Ranking and Survey, or GEURS, again ranked ASU second among public U.S. universities for employable graduates — ahead of UCLA, the University of Michigan and Purdue. That same expertise now supports Arizona’s public workforce, offering learning experiences that help employees meet today’s challenges while preparing for those ahead.

“As a lifelong Arizonan, I’ve seen firsthand the impact public employees have in every community across our state,” said Nancy Gonzales, executive vice president and university provost. “Arizona will continue to thrive thanks to programs like this one, which ensures that our public employees have opportunities to learn and grow throughout their careers. This partnership reflects ASU’s commitment to transforming the university experience into a lifelong relationship that empowers people at every stage of life.”

Eligible employees were able to participate in one of two program types designed to meet different professional goals:

Skills-based courses, focused primarily on digital and project management skills — including areas such as data analytics, agile project management and technology-enabled collaboration — many of which can be completed in eight hours or less.

Career certificate programs, providing deeper study in leadership, strategic thinking and data-driven decision-making.

Each offering provides practical, job-relevant tools that employees can apply immediately in their work. Upon completion, participants earn a digital credential from ASU, which can be shared in professional portfolios or annual performance evaluations.

The partnership also includes up to eight keynote sessions throughout the year, led by ASU experts, on leadership, innovation and managing change — giving employees a chance to learn together and share ideas across agencies.

By connecting the state’s workforce goals with ASU’s learning resources, the collaboration strengthens leadership and innovation across public service and supports Arizona’s capacity to adapt, grow and shape what’s next.

While the program is at capacity, eligible employees can visit hr.az.gov/asu-careercatalyst-program to explore available offerings and join an interest list.

According to a 2024 survey, there is widespread misunderstanding among many Americans around the nuances of the First Amendment.

The survey, “The First Amendment: Where America Stands,” revealed that fewer than half of Americans can name all the freedoms guaranteed by the amendment, a number that has steadily declined since 2020.

To help close that gap, NEWSWELL at Arizona State University has joined forces with the Freedom Forum to launch the First Amendment Academy, a series of online courses designed to empower citizens. 

By exploring the five core freedoms — religion, speech, press, assembly and petition — the program aims to give Americans the tools to not only recognize their rights but also put them into action in their daily lives.

“The First Amendment is foundational to American democracy and individual freedoms,” said Nicole Carroll, executive director for NEWSWELL at ASU — a nonprofit affiliated with the university that promotes local journalism — and a professor of practice in the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication. “We’re proud this partnership can create these classes and quizzes to help people better understand these critical rights.”

Blending Freedom Forum’s trusted expertise, NEWSWELL’s wide-reaching media network and ASU’s leadership in online learning, the First Amendment Academy delivers an accessible and dynamic learning experience. 

The academy features 15 interactive, self-guided courses alongside 25 flash quizzes designed to sharpen civic knowledge.

Each course takes just 10–20 minutes and is packed with real-world examples that bring constitutional principles to life. Best of all, the courses are free — anyone can enroll through ASU’s online platform. The quizzes are also available directly on the academy’s website with no registration required, and they can be embedded directly on other media’s news pages.

“This initiative is a step forward in our mission to educate, engage and inspire people about their First Amendment freedoms,” said Jan Neuharth, chair and CEO of the Freedom Forum. “By making these resources widely accessible and interactive, we’re helping people not only understand their rights but also feel empowered to exercise and defend them.”

The “Where America Stands” survey also revealed that the proportion of Americans who could identify freedom of the press as a right guaranteed by the First Amendment dropped from 72% in 2020 to 57% in 2024.

“First Amendment freedoms are unique to American democracy, special and fragile,” said Mi-Ai Parrish, managing director of ASU Media Enterprise and a professor of practice in the Cronkite School. “All citizens being knowledgeable about the protections is part of a healthy democracy.”

In addition, the survey uncovered divides across demographics. When asked which liberty matters most, men overwhelmingly pointed to free speech, while women were more likely to view all five freedoms as equally vital. And minority groups, younger Americans and those with lower incomes reported feeling less connection to — or less benefiting from — the protections of the First Amendment.

Perhaps most alarming, the survey showed a clear generational gap: The younger the respondent, the weaker their bond with the freedoms that define American democracy. That was hard to hear, Carroll said.

“I was surprised and a little saddened, but then I was inspired to think about what NEWSWELL could do to help solve this problem,” she said. “That’s where these classes come in handy.”

More than half of American adults drink alcohol, and 17% of them binge drink, consuming more than five drinks in one sitting for men, or more than four for women. 

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, binge drinking costs the economy $250 billion each year and can lead to problems such as increased exposure to violence and injury, overdose, alcohol poisoning and, for women, risk of miscarriage or stillbirth.

This type of excessive drinking is most common among younger adults, and using cannabis during late adolescence or early adulthood is known to increase the risk of engaging in binge drinking. 

Now, new research from the Arizona State University Department of Psychology shows that this increase in risk of binge drinking from cannabis use varies with age, peaking around age 20.

“We found that during ages 18 to 20, cannabis motivates people to binge drink more often, while later in adulthood, around age 24, it motivates them to binge drink less. This dichotomy has consequences for prevention and treatment efforts,” said Jack Waddell, assistant professor of psychology at ASU and first author on the study.

The study used cannabis use and alcohol consumption data from the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence, a long-term study of over 500 participants with sites in California, Oregon, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. The work was published in Alcohol Clinical and Experimental Research.

Waddell described the interaction of cannabis use and alcohol consumption as a complex relationship. 

He has previously found that individuals who use both alcohol and cannabis report higher rates of substance use disorder than those who use just one. Yet, he has also found that many individuals who use both alcohol and cannabis perceive using them together as being protective against some of the negative consequences of excessive drinking.

In the current study, he and his collaborators expected using cannabis to consistently increase the likelihood of the study participants engaging in binge drinking, not for it to flip from enabling excessive drinking in late teens and early 20s to blunting it around age 24.

“People are reducing their binge drinking but they’re switching to cannabis. This can be viewed positively from a harm-reduction standpoint, but it is important to understand that there are still a lot of risks associated with cannabis use,” Waddell said.

Waddell wants to understand how people end up using more than one substance, and to do this, he plans to study how people think about and use substances on a day-to-day basis.

“What is it that motivates the transition from using one substance to more than one? Is it someone’s affective experiences — their emotions and moods — whenever they’re using alcohol or cannabis that makes them want to add the other? Is it the social environment?” he asked.

Going forward, Waddell plans to use technology-enhanced momentary assessments, which are questionnaires or check-ins delivered by push notification on an app or text message, to study people’s behavior in the moment. 

Having a finer-grained level of access to how different kinds of substance use interact with and influence each other will lead to better treatment and prevention strategies.

It has long been understood that there are biological differences between sexes, but it has only been around a decade since federally funded biomedical research has been required to include females in the U.S.

And it is more important than ever to recognize the importance of these differences and to fully fund research on women’s health, according to Arizona State University President’s Professor Heather Bimonte-Nelson, who has been studying female neurobiology and the impact of hormones during aging for decades.

For example, women are more likely to be misdiagnosed when having a heart attack than men. This discrepancy happens because women experience different symptoms from men, such as anxiety or shoulder pain — and until a few years ago, these symptoms were not widely publicized or communicated to the medical community.

Bimonte-Nelson recently authored an essay on how sex inclusivity in science benefits all of us. She explains that science has a lot left to discover about sex differences that will be impactful to human health across the lifespan.

Question: Why is it important for basic science research and clinical research to include both male and female participants?

Answer: Studies using only males make up the majority of the biomedical literature, but sex and sex hormones affect every level of our biology, from molecules to cells to entire systems, even including overall brain structure. Innumerable scientific principles and profiles of disease manifestation, symptom presentation and sequalaeThe aftereffects of a disease, condition or injury. are based on studies performed only in males, which means female data are interpreted to be a variant arising from a male-centric gold standard. This is inappropriate and insufficient at best. It should not be assumed that outcomes in one sex will apply to all individuals — because they do not.

Q: Does basic biology or cognition really differ across the sexes?

A: The short answer is yes.

Many developmental, neuropsychiatric, neurological and neurodegenerative disorders vary by sex in their prevalence, symptomology and progression. For example, premature female infants recover better from intracranial hemorrhage than do males; women are more likely to be diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders and major depressive disorders; and there is a male bias in the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders, with sex differences in symptom presentation including restricted, repetitive and externalizing behavior patterns. There are sex differences in long-term consequences of traumatic brain injury that have a distinct molecular-associated inflammatory signature. Women are nearly two times more likely than men to develop an adverse drug reaction. A report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office showed that of 10 drugs withdrawn from the U.S. market over a four-year time frame, eight of them had greater health risks in women, with the report concluding that this was driven by a lack of representation of females in the studies leading to FDA approval. Yet, the majority of drugs lack sex-specific recommendations and guidelines.

About a decade ago, the National Institutes of Health formally mandated that males and females must be considered in the design, analysis and reporting of all federally funded biomedical research. While this has been an important turning point, finding sex differences in a domain does not mean that they are well-characterized. Discovering driving mechanisms, symptomology and treatment outcomes are necessary to obtain the bigger picture and have a real impact on health and disease.

Q: What motivated you to study women’s health and cognition?

A: I am driven to discover factors that impact women’s health and sex differences relating to neurological functions because there is a marked knowledge gap in this domain. My lab focuses on neurological functions such as memory, depression and anxiety because they impact everyday quality of life in women.

Memory can decline with menopause, and depression and anxiety have been shown to increase during this time as well. How specific menopause types, prior hormone exposures and subsequent hormone therapies impact these outcomes have yet to be determined, but there is evidence that they each influence neurological function. My lab is working to decipher which variations of menopause and hormone exposures across the lifespan impact these brain functions and to identify the biological drivers of these effects. 

Q: What do you want everyone to understand about what there is to gain from studying sex differences?

A: Sex differences are one type of individual difference that are relevant to health and disease. Female biology, anatomy and function should not be dismissed and treated as irrelevant. We will not have rigor, precision and excellence in science and medicine without accuracy, and accuracy requires an accounting of the variables that impact health and disease. The studies done to date provide indisputable evidence that sex is one of these variables. Sex differences should be studied and embraced, and need not be a barrier to scientific discovery. Only when we embrace this source of individual variability will we have rigor, precision and excellence in science and medicine. ... When we have this, we impact all individuals.

Today, there are approximately 14,000 active satellites in orbit around Earth. The number is expected to grow to more than 65,000 by 2030. This rapid expansion of the space economy is outpacing the capabilities of the existing supply chain, which historically has been small, specialized and slow.

As governments and commercial entities race to claim their space in the sky, their pace has been throttled by long lead times for production of critical components — delays that threaten the success of missions essential to U.S. national defense and economic leadership in space.

Swift Coat, an Arizona State University spinout venture, is helping to confront that challenge.

Over the past 18 months, the company has adapted its proprietary coating technology, Aerosol Impaction-Driven Assembly, to enable domestic production of advanced coatings and components for the aerospace, solar and semiconductor industries.

One of its coatings boosts the power produced by solar panels on satellites by 4%, which enables reducing the size of panels as well as lowering satellite launch costs.

The results have led to more than $4 million in contracts within the aerospace industry.

To meet this growing demand, Swift Coat has expanded operations from its nucleation site in ASU’s MacroTechnology Works semiconductor fabrication facility into a 16,000-square-foot building in north Phoenix, where it plans to double its workforce within six months.

This growth trajectory has been noticed by the Arizona Chamber of Commerce & Industry and the Arizona Manufacturers Council, which has recently named Swift Coat Arizona’s Small Manufacturer of the Year.

“Swift Coat is exactly the kind of company we love to highlight,” says Grace Appelbe, executive director of the Arizona Manufacturers Council. “It’s homegrown, innovative and solving real-world challenges in smart, practical ways.”

“The Manufacturer of the Year Awards recognize companies that are creating quality jobs, contributing to Arizona’s economic growth, and keeping our state at the forefront of modern manufacturing,” Appelbe says. “That’s what makes Swift Coat a standout among this year’s honorees.”

Swift Coat was honored alongside other Arizona manufacturing leaders, including Axon (Large Manufacturer of the Year) and Four Peaks Brewing Company (Excellence in Sustainability), at the Manufacturer of the Year Awards on Oct. 28.

The Arizona Manufacturers Council described Swift Coat as having developed “cutting-edge coating technology” that enables producing many products and materials that are significantly more durable and energy efficient.

Swift Coat’s success reflects ASU’s growing role as a catalyst for Arizona’s manufacturing resurgence.

“It is emblematic of the ecosystem we’re building,” says Zachary Holman, vice dean for research and innovation in the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at ASU, who is also Swift Coat’s cofounder. “We’re proud to see companies that have gotten started at ASU earning recognition for advancing high-tech manufacturing and strengthening Arizona’s economy.”

Peter Firth, a graduate of the Fulton Schools and Swift Coat’s other cofounder and chief executive officer, attributes much of the company’s success to the early and continued support of ASU.

“ASU provided mentorship and access to resources in the company’s early days to help us bridge the gap between academia and industry,” Firth says. “Today we continue to partner with the university on projects in order to leverage their world-class facilities, faculty and students.”

Following its Small Manufacturer of the Year Award, Swift Coat will next expand its coating manufacturing capability to meet the demands of the growing U.S. aerospace market and launch new coating products for use in the semiconductor industry.

The company is building manufacturing capacity large enough to support the entire U.S. satellite market, which includes a multimillion-dollar investment in equipment and a doubling of staff over the next six months.

“With support from ASU, the Arizona’s Manufacturing Council and the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, we hope one day we’ll be considered for the council’s medium and large manufacturer of the year awards,” Firth says.

As both Arizona State University and Taiwan have become major players in Arizona’s burgeoning semiconductor industry, the university has worked to nurture its ties to the island.

This fall, ASU President Michael Crow traveled to Taiwan to meet with top leaders in industry and education, as well as with ASU alumni.

“We talked about how ASU can partner and deliver workforce at scale for TSMC and other industry partners, as well as have a place for Taiwanese companies and innovations to grow in Arizona,” said Grace O’Sullivan, vice president of corporate engagement and strategic partnerships for ASU, who accompanied Crow to Taiwan.

ASU has seen an uptick of Sun Devils coming from Taiwan in recent years. Overall, 531 students from Taiwan studied at ASU in the 2024–25 academic year, an increase of more than 70% from 2021–22.

Also this fall, a delegation from Taiwan traveled to Arizona for SEMICON West, the flagship U.S. microelectronics trade show, held in Phoenix for the first time, and signed an agreement while they were here. ASU, the Arizona Commerce Authority, the city of Phoenix and Taiwan Digital Health Industry Development Association all signed a “declaration of collaboration” to promote Taiwanese companies in the U.S. and global markets with Arizona as a hub.

The signing also celebrated the opening of the Taiwan AI Smart Health Showcase Center, which features 15 innovative Taiwan-based health care companies, based in the 850 PBC building in the Phoenix Bioscience Core.

The agreement’s goals are to:

“Advancement in biomedical and medical device industries will not only drive innovation in patient care and scientific discovery, it will produce devices and therapies that will help treat chronic conditions and reduce health care costs,” Crow said at the signing.

“Arizona State University is excited to be part of this collaborative effort, working with partners in Arizona and Taiwan, to strengthen resilience in this important area of technological convergence.”

While in Taiwan, Crow met with the president and leadership team of National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University.

O’Sullivan said that ASU is comparable to NYCU, which not only has expertise in semiconductors but also created one of the first biomedical engineering-based medical schools, similar to ASU’s new John Shufeldt School of Medicine and Medical Engineering.

“We’re working toward building a comprehensive partnership with them, including a seed research fund and curriculum exchanges,” she said.

“We also met with the Ministry of Education and talked about building English and Mandarin language training, back and forth, to further support students and exchanges.”

A key part of Crow’s visit was meeting with the leadership team at TSMC, where he thanked them for their partnership with ASU, which is the No. 1 supplier of workers to them in Arizona.

“ASU’s partnership with TSMC and Taiwan fuses leading semiconductor innovation with bold research and scalable talent pipelines, which will be the foundation for our AI and quantum future,” O’Sullivan said.

“It’s a catalyst for U.S. leadership and will create trillions in global impact.”

The trip also included meetings with leadership from the Industrial Technology Research Institute, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the latter two highlighting ASU’s Innovation Zones as a catalyst for enhancing STEM research, education and development.

While in Asia, Crow traveled to South Korea, where he met with LG Energy Solution, which has invested $5.5 billion in battery manufacturing facilities in Queen Creek, Arizona; NAVER, the dominant search engine in South Korea; KRAFTON, one of the world’s largest video gaming companies; and education leaders.

They may have just stepped out of their teens, but they’re already stepping up to change the world. 

The latest ""AZ Inno Under 25” list, published by the Phoenix Business Journal, includes four rising stars from Arizona State University: students Camille S. Campbell, Sandul Gangodagamage and Kentarou Siejak, and alumnus Will Xander. 

The annual list honors entrepreneurs under 25 who are daring to disrupt industries and redefine what’s possible through bold, creative ventures.

Between them, they’ve written books, launched startups and nonprofits, produced films, delivered TEDx Talks, and collected an impressive lineup of awards and prize money. 

These young innovators are not just shaping Arizona’s future but making waves on a global scale.

At just 21, Camille S. Campbell already has a résumé that reads like the life’s work of someone twice her age. A published author by 14 and founder of a nonprofit by 20, the third-year student is proving that creativity and technology can thrive together.

“I’ve always been passionate about storytelling and the transformative effect stories can have on people,” Campbell said. “They can better lives, inspire change and empower others to tell their own stories.”

ASU honors student authors book celebrating beauty, culture of Ukraine

That mission started early. Growing up in New Mexico and later Scottsdale, Arizona, she was homeschooled before studying at ASU, where she’s now a double major in finance and digital marketing at the W. P. Carey School of Business and a Barrett, The Honors College student.

“I think being homeschooled made me a self-starter,” she said. “It taught me how to balance a lot at once.”

Her first nonprofit, Rising Poets Community, launched when she was just 17. Since then, it’s distributed thousands of free books to children worldwide, including those in Ukraine through her art therapy initiative “Colors of Ukraine.” The picture book, which she both authored and funded through the ASU’s Venture Devils 2024 social impact pitch competition and private philanthropists, was given free to children in war zones.

“I wanted to give them something that brings hope — a book that could be theirs, even in the middle of chaos,” she said.

But Campbell’s vision extends far beyond storytelling. Her latest venture, the AI Innovators Foundation, bridges creativity and technology by teaching kids about artificial intelligence through storytelling and hands-on projects.

“I want to show students that AI isn’t something to fear,” she said. “It’s a tool for creativity and a co-creator that helps us imagine and build new things.”

Campbell is also a co-director of AI Salon Arizona, a global organization fostering discussion around the intersection of technology and humanity. This week, she’s moderating a panel at ASU’s AI conference, which she considers another milestone on a list that keeps growing.

When asked how she manages her workload — seven published books, two majors, two nonprofits, and leadership in AI circles — Campbell laughed.

“Sometimes it’s a lot, but I genuinely love it,” she said. “The passion drives me.”

As she looks ahead to graduation in 2027, Campbell is already developing a storytelling technology platform that she hopes will empower everyone to be a creator.

“Canva made design accessible to everyone,” she says. “I want to do that for storytelling and help people become the main character of their own lives.”

When Sandul Gangodagamage talks about building a gaming company in college, his excitement is threaded with a strong passion to build great products for millions across the world.

Born in Minnesota and now residing in Arizona, the 20-year-old is a third-year student at the W. P. Carey School of Business studying business and computer science. He launched Legion Platforms from a problem he knew firsthand: bad internet, weak computers and games that took up hundreds of gigabytes.

“I just couldn't access games at all,” Gangodagamage said. “It would take 15, 20 minutes to load … the games were so laggy. It was basically unplayable.”

What began as a pirate game in high school has become a platform company. Gangodagamage said the first title reached 500,000 players while he was a senior in 2023; today, Legion Platforms claims 13 million users and aims for 20 million within a year.

“We’re the largest gaming company in Arizona, but we’re just getting started,” said Gangodagamage, whose entrepreneurial drive has already earned him top honors in several university pitch competitions. They include first place in ASU Venture Devils, Tech Devil’s Innovation and Lab-to-Launch. He also received recognition as a 2025 first-place regional winner in Princeton’s TigerLaunch, the world’s largest student-run entrepreneurship contest.

By building browser-based, cloud-optimized multiplayer games that load in seconds and run on low-end machines, Legion avoids downloads, storage bloat and lag. The result is a product designed for dorm-room MacBooks and handheld phones. This accessibility-first design philosophy means anyone from across the world can access a 3D multiplayer experience in seconds, bridging the gap between high-quality graphics and universal playability. Legion is also completely free to play, built on a mission to bring gaming to everyone. 

He said he builds games for everyone so friends can invite friends, play together and spread the product by word of mouth. The games are built to spark interaction, whether through quick competitive matches, shared achievements or in-game events, Gangodagamage said. 

“The majority of our users that I’ve met in person have told me they found out about our games through a friend telling them,” Gangodagamage said. “Word of mouth is huge.”

For Gangodagamage, success isn’t measured in profit margins, but in the number of people whose lives his platform can touch. His vision is bold and unshakable: to make Legion a name known in households everywhere, sparking conversations and inspiring players for years to come.

“The goal is to literally change the world,” he said.

Eighteen-year-old Kentarou Siejak is redefining what it means to be a changemaker. A second-year W. P. Carey School of Business student, he’s already an entrepreneur, public speaker, author and film producer with a vision far beyond his years.

“I’ve lived all over the world as a military kid,” said Siejak, who routinely delivers TEDx Talks and keynote speeches to college students and organizations. “I’ve seen how awful the world can be and how amazing it can be. If each person strives to do more in support of others, we’d all be in a much better place.”

That belief in leading by example drives everything Siejak does. From tech startups to community mentorship, he’s proving that innovation can also have heart. His current projects — most in the AI and robotics space — are designed to make technology more human-centered. One team he helped build is developing a phone case that uses microfluid technology to help people who are blind read from their screens.

“That one excites me the most,” he said with a grin. “It’s about creating something useful that really changes lives.”

Siejak’s passion for impact also extends to film. He’s producing a feature-length movie on mental health awareness, which was shot entirely on an iPhone and produced at ASU’s Piper Writers House.

“I want to show people you don’t need a big budget to make something meaningful,” he said. “Mental health isn’t just a struggle — it’s proof that you can rise above what tries to hold you back.”

Despite his remarkable list of achievements, Siejak is disarmingly humble.

“I don’t think I’m a prodigy,” said Siejak, who also offers leadership coaching to organizations. “I just hate seeing potential wasted. So many young people have ideas but stop because they’re told they can’t. I want to be living proof that you can.”

He’s already written two books — “Teen Success: From Nothing to Something” and “Teen Failure: From Nothing to Nothing” — a candid reflection on the highs and lows of ambition. A third book on leadership is on the way.

“It’s about the lessons I’ve learned leading teams since I was 6 years old,” he says. “Leadership is everything. It’s what makes or breaks a business, a community, even a society.”

Will Xander already carries the confidence and composure of a seasoned entrepreneur. The 23-year-old is the founder and CEO of Truthkeep, an AI-driven data analytics company serving Fortune 500 semiconductor clients. 

Before he graduated from Arizona State University in 2024 with a degree in organizational leadership and project management, Xander had already closed over $60 million in real estate deals as a multifamily broker for Scottsdale-based ORION Investment Real Estate.

“I always knew that my steppingstone into the business world would be through being a commercial real estate broker,” Xander said. “If you worked really hard and understood the business, you could make good money. It was one of those moments where hard work and preparation met good luck.”

That success gave him the freedom to pursue his deeper passion for technology and innovation.

“I’ve always been curious about how things progress — technology, the economy, inventions, the way society evolves,” he said. “After my success in real estate, I knew I needed to start an AI company.”

Founded in 2023, Truthkeep helps large semiconductor firms manage and interpret enormous amounts of data, from product specs to customer insights. The company’s AI systems analyze tens of thousands of data points each month to identify trends and inefficiencies.

“Our platform helps teams develop smarter roadmaps,” Xander said. “If a customer is struggling with a certain product, our system highlights that and directs it to the right team to fix.”

Running a company, he says, isn’t much different from selling.

“Being a CEO is really just being a salesperson,” he said. “You’re creating relationships, fostering trust and providing real value.”

Xander’s team of 13 operates largely remotely, though the company is based in Tempe.

“We’re a lean, productive team,” he said, adding that his focus is not on size but on solving big problems. “We want to create massive impact. Semiconductor is one of the most important industries in the world, and that’s what wakes me up in the morning.”

His road to ASU was far from straightforward.

“I was denied from ASU at first,” he recalled. “It was ego-shocking as a 17-year-old, but it made me work harder.”

After appealing the decision and taking two prerequisite classes, he earned A’s in both and eventually graduated with honors.

“Being denied was a blessing in disguise,” he said. “It forced me to be more self-aware and disciplined.”

Recognition for his accomplishments, he says, is nice but not the goal.

“It’s just a pit stop — like stopping at the gas station on the way to California,” he said with a laugh. “I’m grateful for the recognition, but this isn’t about me. It’s about my team and the people who believed in us.”

When asked if he sees himself as successful, Xander paused.

“Maybe once or twice a month I think, ‘good job,’” he said. “But this is only chapter one. I believe humans are meant to work, innovate and change the world. That’s why I’m here.”

A new report from the Center for American Institutions at Arizona State University highlights the lack of trust the public has in the judicial system.

""The Politicization of Our Courts,"" released this fall, looks at how distrust in the U.S. Supreme Court, as well as political polarization, has filtered down to state judiciaries.

That lack of trust extends to many American institutions — a problem the center was created to address, according to Donald Critchlow, director of the center and the Katzin Family Professor of History.

“We’ve seen a precipitous erosion in trust in all of these institutions — political, governmental, religious, educational, judicial, military. And it's not healthy for democracy,” he said.

“We need to figure out why people distrust their institutions and how to renew and strengthen these institutions. That's what our mission's about.”

The center, which was formed three years ago, is privately funded and has launched several activities in support of civic engagement — reports, a student club, postdoctoral teaching fellows and a monthly lunch discussion. 

The center’s faculty teach a certificate program in political history and leadership, in the School of Historical, Philosophical and Religious Studies, which has 120 students.

The judiciary report included a survey of people’s attitudes toward trust in their courts and also looked at six states where there were retention or elections for state Supreme Court justices. One of those states was Wisconsin, which was in the middle of a record $100 million election race for state Supreme Court at the time the survey was taken.

“Our findings were quite extraordinary. In Wisconsin, while the survey was being conducted during this Supreme Court race, most people could not answer how their Supreme Court justices were selected,” Critchlow said.

“I think our other arresting finding was that most people in the survey want justices to be elected, but they don't like the money involved in in the election process. So, somewhat contradictory — they want politics, but don't want politics.”

The report recommends that states use a guided-appointment system for the judiciary, like Arizona does, and also that the courts engage with the public more to explain their decisions.

“They tend to use law legalese and the decisions aren't very clear to the public,” Critchlow said.

“Most decisions are not political and don't involve political affairs, but the public needs to be better educated on what the state supreme courts actually do, as well as what the U.S. Supreme Court does.”

This report joins a lineup of previous national commission reports: “Civic Education in the Military,” “The Study of American History in Our Universities” and “A Thousand Points of Light Still Shine.” 

The center’s student-run Politics and Leadership Club has more than 150 members, with 50 to 60 typically gathering every week for “Monday Dialogues.” The topics so far this semester have included “Divided Reality: Political Polarization and the Evolution of American Discourse” and “Campaign Finance: Is Dark Money Corrosive to American Politics?”

Later this semester, members will discuss “Raising a Family in Contemporary America” and “The Age of AI: Jobs of Tomorrow for College Graduates.”

The meetings try to be as accessible as possible, giving everyone a chance to speak, according to Jake Dueck, the club president.

“We are very proud that the Politics and Leadership Club has a very diverse range of perspectives. I always tell people we have everything from libertarians to communists and all the stuff in between,” said Dueck, who is double-majoring in history and political science with a minor in public service and public policy.

“We want to make sure that everyone can participate and that everyone can offer their piece.”

Dueck moderates the free-form discussions, which are civil and polite.

“I try to prioritize people that have counterpoints to things that have already been said. But our number one priority is to have as many different people talk as possible,” he said.

The Center for American Institutions supports the club with marketing, advising and catering the meetings.

Elise Johnson, who is majoring in politics in the economy, is vice president of the club and said that the discussions are a place to be fearless.

“A lot of times students will be like, ‘Oh, I don't want to say what I think about this because so-and-so will get mad at me.’

“But the nice thing about the club is that everybody acknowledges, ‘Hey, half the people in the room probably don't agree with me, but here's what I have to say.’ People might push back a little bit but you’re fighting against the arguments, not the people.”

Dueck said the mutual respect and rapport is what sets the club apart.

“There is a kind of hunger for productive, interesting, stimulating discussion that's hard to find, not just at ASU or at colleges, but just generally nowadays — especially among our chronically online generation,” he said.

Both Dueck and Johnson are pursuing certificates in political history and leadership, and both are research assistants for the center who worked on the judiciary report, finding scholarly articles, books and newspaper stories going back to the 1960s.

“After researching the report, I feel like I have like enough authority on the subject to have a logical discussion with somebody about it and say, ‘What do you think about this?’” Johnson said.

“I have facts to back up what I'm saying and I know what's going on.”

For 11 years, the Future Security Forum has convened elected officials, policymakers, military leaders, academics and policy analysts to discuss the future of the free world. This year, attendees confronted a world where opportunities, and threats, multiply each day.

“National security is not just a military issue, as all of you know; it's a much more complicated set of relationships, partnerships, alliances and economic interactions,” said Arizona State University President Michael Crow in a video speech welcoming this year’s attendees. 

Crow clearly outlined the charge to this year’s forum: “What we need are more ideas, more creativity, more resilient responses, more ways to react to the environment in a quicker fashion.”

For nine hours, attendees delved into current challenges, threats and the future, stopping only for lunch and to top off their coffee. The event was hosted by ASU and New America, drawing people from across the world to New America’s office less than a city block from the White House. This unique partnership is led at ASU by the Future Security Initiative and at New America by its Future Security program, which connect a team of over 80 faculty and fellows, co-directed by ASU professors of practice Peter Bergen and Daniel Rothenberg.

This year, the forum was also co-hosted in collaboration with Security & Defence PLuS, a global partnership between ASU, King’s College London and the University of New South Wales.

“The forum shows how a nonpartisan, D.C.-based think tank can partner with a major public research university to address the world’s biggest challenges,” said New America CEO Anne-Marie Slaughter in the forum’s opening plenary. “ASU always wins the U.S. News & World Report 'Most Innovative' university ranking, and it deserves it.”

“The really good thing about the economic relationship going for the U.S. and the U.K. is that we've got about a trillion invested in each other's economies,” said James Roscoe, U.K. acting ambassador (chargé d'affaires) to the U.S., in a panel on the future of U.S.-U.K. relations. “One of my favorite stats is, every day in America, about 1.2 million people get up and go and work for a British company, and in the U.K., 1.8 million Brits wake up and work for an American company.”

Throughout the panel, Roscoe and Slaughter discussed the status of this “special relationship,” America’s relationship with Europe and threats to the Atlantic Alliance. 

“I think there's a tendency in some parts of Europe — particularly when they look at this government in Washington — to think that Europe now has to do it all alone. And I think that's both dangerous and wrong,” Roscoe said. “We need security to be a North Atlantic security; we need to be as ready to help America, if we need to, as we need America to be ready to help us. And, frankly, that's the only way to really achieve real deterrence from the threats that we face.”

The forum hosted Brett McGurk, a senior national security official during the Bush, Obama, Trump and Biden administrations who led the global campaign to defeat ISIS, to discuss the state of the Middle East.

McGurk recalled how he was tasked with “telling the president the truth in five minutes” every morning — truths that seemingly changed by the minute no matter the administration. In fact, McGurk described how deeply thought-out plans were upended regularly, like when a planned trip for former President Joe Biden to visit Israel the week after the Oct. 7 attacks was changed after a bombing of a Gaza hospital.

“You can think you're on one path walking in the morning at 9 o'clock, or 7:30 in the morning, whatever time, and by 1 o'clock something happens to completely wipe it off the fold,” McGurk said.

The forum also hosted a panel discussing relations with Pakistan — where a main focus was the country’s climate crisis.

“Climate is not an abstract for Pakistan,” said Rizwan Saeed Sheikh, Pakistan ambassador to the United States. “It's a reality that we are living, even now as we speak.”

Floods in the country have included cloudbursts, or sudden, intense downpours that will disperse a year’s worth of rainfall in an hour. And Sheikh shared that the country is anticipating monsoon season earlier than usual. Pakistan needs an estimated $152 billion to cover climate-related costs.

“It's real, clear and present danger that we are faced with,” Sheikh said.

AI, including its promise and its many challenges, was discussed at length at the forum — especially how the changing landscape of technology coincides with changing worldwide threats.

In attendance was U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, who spoke on AI and how the United States needs to focus on staying ahead of the innovation cycle. 

“AI has been described as being as disruptive as electricity was in the 20th century,” said Kelly. “It's powerful, it's promising, but we’ve got to get it right. It could be one of the greatest drivers of prosperity across the world. But we could also screw it up.”

And while panels featured speakers that were policymakers, ASU faculty and government officials, panels also included industry leaders like Northrop Grumman corporate chief technology officer Greg Simer, who discussed the changing nature of conflict given rapidly advancing technology.

“We take for granted connectivity. We take for granted the data that's out there, when you think about long-range use, extended terrain, the tyranny of range,” said Simer. “We need to be able to connect all of our platforms, our spacecraft, undersea, across all domains. Otherwise, all these things that we're talking about with AI and data manipulation and how we pull information of space, is only going to work if we can move that data around.”

Although panelists discussed technology, AI and international relations, the day’s through line was how America can best prepare for any threat in an increasingly dangerous world.

For some, like ASU Professor of Practice Peter Singer, this meant paying special attention to the past. Singer presented on how the country can focus on lessons from past conflicts, including rethinking the way the country handles the “math” of war with new factors like generative AI and drones, building cognitive toughness just as much as physical toughness, and learning to win.

For others, this meant looking to younger generations and discussing how older generations can work with them so that today’s youth can think critically and develop other essential skills.

“We need to start thinking like our life depends upon it — our survival depends upon our ability to think,” said retired CIA senior analyst Gina Bennett in a panel on predicting future threats. “Ultimately, where I'm concerned about generative AI and agentic AI is that it feeds on some of the worst traits of humanity — laziness and greed — and we're going to let it think for us, and then we're going to let it decide for us.”

The forum closed with an announcement: New America’s new Future Security Scenarios Lab, a space dedicated to concentrated efforts on planning for a multitude of different scenarios in America’s security future.

“The lab grew out of the recognition that the security landscape is changing, and it's changing faster than the systems we've built to keep it secure,” said Amy Nelson, director of the Future Security Scenarios Lab. “What we need is newer ways of thinking if we're going to keep pace.”

The lab will use methods like wargaming, immersive exercises, decision theory and scenario planning to discuss a multitude of different futures.

Nelson explained that the lab’s remit “is not to predict the future, but to expand the range of futures we can be prepared for.”

Eleven years wasn’t the only anniversary being celebrated. A few speakers noted that America will soon be celebrating its 250th year, making the forum a true moment to reflect.

“Democracy is hard — it’s hard to get right, and democracy is constantly disrupted by the fact that we are advanced, innovative economies who come up with new ideas about how things should work, whether that's, you know, a newspaper, or whether it's an algorithm. We are constantly having to adapt democracy to new realities,” Roscoe said. “I think the reality that we face at the moment is an incredibly disrupted world.”

Curiosity. Agility. Grit.

These are just a few of the essential characteristics that future public servants will need to manage the challenges and chaos in the field of public administration, said a panel of experts who spoke about the discipline’s future at Arizona State University's Downtown Phoenix campus on Tuesday.

“We are not as innovative as we need to be in government,” ASU President Michael Crow said. “We need to do a better job of training, educating, empowering, labeling, everything. It's time for the modernization of everything. All the chaos going on right now? I'm fine with it. It's going to give us every opportunity to really look at things in new ways and move things forward in new directions.”

Crow was joined by moderator Shannon Portillo, director of ASU's School of Public Affairs; James-Christian Blockwood, president and CEO of the National Academy of Public Administration; and Ed Zuercher, executive director of the Maricopa Association of Governments. The discussion underscored the need for public servants to be adaptable and committed to helping others even with the evolving landscape of political disruptions and technological changes.

Blockwood echoed that disruption isn’t necessarily negative, but it requires future public servants to be able to engage in healthy dialogue. He has witnessed that people are too quickly losing the ability to productively disagree. How to maintain respectful discourse needs to be addressed in classes, as well as in society, he said.

Crow briefly touched on the federal government shutdown, pointing out that service interruptions, such as flight delays due to shortages of air traffic controllers, illustrate the necessity of government programs and those who deliver them, even though those programs are often taken for granted. 

We need a public service that is “full-throated” in defense of the value it adds, Crow said.

That lack of acknowledgement for the value of public services is “The Walking Dead” theory of government, Zuercher said. In one scene of the postapocalyptic hit TV show, the protagonists are killing zombies, and in the next scene their clothes are freshly laundered and pressed and their teeth are clean. Yet viewers seemed to not question or care where the characters got clean water after the collapse of modern civilization and the services it provides.

“It's an example of the success of how we do government in the United States that people do take those sort of life-giving things for granted. We're very fortunate,” Zuercher said. “But we've got to tell the story better because that's the story of administrative capacity and the power of administration in the United States.”

Administrative capacity continues to grow, thanks in part to technological advances and AI.

“If you think about artificial intelligence and technology, there is ultimate access to information. There's nothing that's not at your fingertips almost immediately, and generally to everyone,” Blockwood said.

AI should be interpreted as augmented rather than artificial intelligence, the panel agreed, noting it is a system created by humans and used by humans to enhance decision-making abilities. 

Crow, an advocate for the use of AI, sees it as a tool for managing complexity and increasing productivity. Zuercher said at some point, the data provided by AI has to be transformed into policies through judgment and compromise by people working together. People, not machines, will implement the policies.

Portillo added that the School of Public Affairs is offering an undergraduate- and graduate-level course in the spring semester called “AI and the Future of Government.”

Yet, despite changes at the federal level and new tools such as AI, the core principles of public service haven't changed. The motivation to pursue a career in public administration still begins with service.

“For a public servant, you want to serve others before yourself — that has to be the main driver. There's many things that people care about, specific issues, but it first starts with service. The motivation has to be service,” Blockwood said.

The event took place in advance of the 2025 Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration Global Conference. This year’s conference, “Making a Difference Globally Through Quality Public Service Education,” is co-hosted by ASU, Northern Arizona University and University of Arizona Oct. 8–10 in Flagstaff, Arizona.

Editor's note: ASU is celebrating Salute to Service on Nov. 7–16, which honors individuals — including military and first responders — and their families who put service above self in both their professional and personal lives.

High-pressure jobs can come with chronic stress, long shifts and unpredictable schedules. These pressures, when not managed, can ripple into family life, affecting both parents’ and children’s emotional well-being.

In response to challenges like these, the Reach Institute at Arizona State University developed ADAPT for First Responders, a new online parenting program that offers research-based guidance to help first responders and other frontline professionals manage the demands of family life and support healthy relationships at home.

“Many families in these professions experience stressors that traditional parenting programs weren’t built to address,” said Abigail Gewirtz, professor of psychology and director of the Reach Institute. “ADAPT for First Responders gives parents practical, flexible tools that fit their unique circumstances.”

Originally developed for military families, ADAPT (Adaptive Parenting Tools) has been redesigned for first responder families with knowledge gained from local partners, including Mesa Fire and Medical Department, Gilbert Police Department and Phoenix Police Department. These partners have highlighted key considerations such as first responder challenges and pain points, barriers to resource utilization and qualities of successful programming.

“Programs like ADAPT are essential for first responders because they recognize the unique stressors we face — not just on the job, but at home,” said Sgt. Mark Worden, who oversees peer support and wellness for the Gilbert Police Department. “I’ve seen firsthand how resources like ADAPT can strengthen families, improve communication and support the overall wellness of our officers. For parents, these programs offer tools to better connect with their children, manage the emotional toll of the job and model resilience in the face of adversity.”

For a limited time, the course is available at no cost for first responders anywhere in the U.S.

Learn how to access the course.

The program is fully online, offering interactive lessons, practical tools and guided exercises that parents can complete on their own schedule. Parents and caregivers learn skills to strengthen communication, manage transitions and build a calm and connected home life.

“This isn’t about adding one more thing to already overburdened parents,” Gewirtz said. “It’s about empowering parents to thrive and help them become their children’s best teachers and role models.”

By launching ADAPT for First Responders, ASU is embedding its use-inspired research directly into the community and helping families reduce stress, improve family relationships and support overall well-being.

“When people are in moments of desperation, simply knowing that a resource exists can help calm the emotional storm,” Worden said. “It creates space for hope, for clarity and for connection. The partnership between Gilbert PD and ASU Reach Institute reflects our shared commitment to proactive, research-backed support for those who serve.”

The program is now open to first responder and frontline families, with free access available for a limited time. Early participants report that the strategies are immediately useful and that their children are noticing the difference, too.

“This work is about resilience at every level,” Gewirtz said. “We’ve seen how the stress of high-demand jobs can spill over into family life. When first responder families have support at home, parents are able to manage those pressures and be there fully for their children — and that, in turn, strengthens their ability to serve the community. It all comes full circle.”

On a rainy fall afternoon, the McCord Hall conference room on Arizona State University’s Tempe campus carried the quiet hum of anticipation. A group of veterans that included both men and women who had worn uniforms across decades, continents and conflicts, settled into their chairs with the easy discipline of people used to showing up early. All came here for one reason: to figure out what comes next.

At the head of the classroom stood Michael Guggemos, tall, broad-shouldered and carrying the kind of presence that doesn’t need to be announced. He wasn’t there to deliver a lecture or to present a PowerPoint. He was there to tell the truth; the kind of truth only someone who had lived through the gauntlet of transition from military life to the corporate battlefield could deliver.

“This isn’t about titles or corner offices,” said Guggemos, a professor of practice in the Department of Information Systems at the W. P. Carey School of Business. “It’s about knowing who you are, what you value and how that lines up with the life you want to live. If you don’t start there, none of the rest matters.”

Around the classroom, heads nodded. Some of the veterans had been out of the service for decades, others only a few years. But all carried the same questions that gnaw at every soldier-turned-civilian: What’s my mission now? Who am I without the uniform? What does my next chapter look like?

For Guggemos, those questions weren’t theoretical. Long before he became a respected executive mentor to veterans, as well as an executive at multiple global Fortune 500 companies, he faced them himself. His decade-long stint in the U.S. Army had shaped his worldview that mainly focused on discipline, service and loyalty. However, it was the messy process of leaving that world behind that forced him to redefine what success meant.

Those interested in AZNext’s Business Readiness for Veterans can register online or find more information here.

That journey eventually led him to play a central role in shaping the AZNext Business Readiness for Veterans program, a business-focused initiative designed to help veterans bridge the daunting gap between military life and civilian careers. It’s a free offering for veterans and current service members interested in business, and those who have recently transitioned and want to increase their business knowledge.

Made possible by a U.S. Department of Labor grant and sponsored by AZNext, the program is offered a few times a year. Billed as being “for vets, by vets,” it brings together a team of instructors who are experienced business leaders, most of whom have served in the military.

The thing that makes this work is authenticity.

“We put the program together based on feedback from both industry and veterans, noting that veterans, while highly sought after for employment, sometimes had difficulties adjusting to work in a high-tech business. They had the knowledge, but they used a different terminology, and were used to different priorities,” said Rob Buelow, program director for AZNext. “So our program helps them translate those service skills into corporate skills by showing them how to connect the dots to what they did in the service and how that works organizationally in the corporate world.”

On paper, the program looks fairly straightforward: modules in communication, human resources, finance and accounting administration, operations, cybersecurity and IT. But in practice, it's a place where veterans strip away the cliches, share the unvarnished truth of their experiences and rediscover how to translate battlefield skills into boardroom credibility.

“The thing that makes this work,” Guggemos says, “is authenticity. Veterans know when someone’s faking it and they also know what organizations say they expect is rarely what they tolerate. What they need isn’t another seminar. They need people who’ve been where they are, who’ve made the same mistakes, who know the cost of getting it wrong.”

For Navy veteran Deirdre Martin, the program meant far more than classroom lessons. It was more of a lifeline, a chance to reclaim her future when the stakes couldn’t have been higher.

Martin enlisted in 1994 and entered as a ship serviceman, responsible for maintaining both the inside and outside surfaces of the vessel. But just as she was settling in, her body began to betray her. At only 21, Martin developed severe joint pain and had difficulty walking. Doctors initially dismissed her symptoms as overuse.

“They thought I’d just overworked my knees, that my ankles needed rehab,” Martin said. For a year and a half, she was misdiagnosed and treated for conditions she didn’t have. Finally, a physician at Portsmouth Naval Hospital diagnosed her with lupus.

Medically retired in 1997 with a disability rating she describes as “lowballed,” Martin left the Navy with little guidance and few resources. Over the years, lupus continued to wreak havoc on her health.

Today, Martin works part time for her church in South Phoenix, where she settled in 2020 after buying a home during the height of the pandemic. While grateful for the job, she realized recently that it wasn’t enough to sustain her long term.

“I woke up and thought, ‘You’re a woman of a particular age. This is good work, but it’s not going to cut it. You need to figure out what’s next.’”

The next step arrived in the form of an email about a veterans’ business cohort.

“I do have an opportunity to go into financial management,” she said. “I signed up two nights ago for this class and thank God they had space for me. I believe it’s divine, and that’s why I’m here.”

The business world loves metrics: revenue growth, market share, quarterly returns. But as Guggemos and his colleagues emphasize, measuring their success goes far beyond job placements or salary bumps.

For many participants, the true impact lies in personal clarity. They want to understand not just what kind of job they want, but what kind of life they’re building. Veterans leave the program with sharpened mission statements that evolve from simple career goals to value-driven philosophies. They begin to see that success isn’t just about climbing a ladder but about aligning work with purpose.

That’s exactly why Charles Husted signed up for the program.

Husted served in the Marines from 2010 to 2014 to see the world. An infantry man, he spent much of his time on Marine expeditionary units, traveling with the Navy on the high seas to project presence abroad.

When he left the Corps, Husted was fortunate to step almost immediately into a promising opportunity. Microsoft had just launched its Software Systems Academy, designed to help transitioning service members move onto IT roles.

From there, Husted’s career accelerated. A former Marine pilot hired him into a corporate role at LA Fitness, where he climbed steadily from quality assurance to developer to data warehouse developer.

“I was working my way up,” he said. “And then COVID-19 happened.”

But rather than retreat, Husted doubled down on education. He enrolled at ASU, earning a bachelor’s degree in business data analytics, and is currently pursuing an MBA at ASU’s W. P. Carey School of Business. Still, he acknowledges finding his way hasn’t been easy.

“I can see where I am, and I can see where I want to go,” Husted said. “But how to get there still eludes me. That’s why I’m here, learning from people with experience. I know someone in this room knows something that can help me get to the next level.”

Word of mouth is what keeps the program growing. Veterans talk, and trust spreads quickly when it’s earned. From coast to coast, stories circulate of former service members who found not just a new job, but a new sense of belonging.

At the center of many of these stories is Guggemos; equal parts mentor, coach and truth-teller.

Years before he ever sat at the head of a table full of fellow veterans, Guggemos was climbing the ranks at Motorola from night shift manufacturing to senior global technology executive for one of America’s most storied technology companies. Its position has faded in the last few decades, yet he arrived during a period of broad market dominance and rapid transformation. The company was evolving from its two-way radios roots into a global player across all forms of mobile communications.

“I was excited to be a Motorolan,” Guggemos said. “I used their kit when in the service, believed in their mission and values.”

By the time Guggemos left, Motorola been through multiple boom-and-bust cycles and ultimately co-led the global splits of IT systems and teams into separate multibillion-dollar global companies across 67 countries. The scale was enormous, the pace relentless and the stakes, which turned out to be both financial and personal, were staggering.

On paper, he was the definition of financial and career success. Senior executive roles followed across multiple companies but life, Guggemos would learn, isn’t lived on paper.

“COVID-19 created global chaos, and as a result, opportunities were greater than ever,” he said. “Network was hot, and opportunities were plenty. But at home, it was a different story.”

Ongoing health issues in Guggemos’ family forced choices few ambitious executives are ever ready to face: continue on with greater challenges or step aside. For Guggemos, the decision was wrenching but clear. He stepped away from business, not because he lacked ambition, but because he understood something many business leaders only grasp in hindsight. That is, career achievements mean little if they come at the expense of family.

“It wasn’t easy, yet was ultimately simple,"" he said. “I enjoy work. I get excited simplifying complexities of people, processes and technologies interacting at global scale, but I worked for my family. I talked about family first for years but did not live it. (That) realization was humbling.”

The decision reshaped not only his life, but his worldview. He began to see career paths less as linear ladders and more as values-driven journeys. For him, success wasn’t about stock prices or executive titles. It was more about whether work aligned with things that mattered most to him.

That evolution in thinking now underpins much of the program. Too often, veterans leaving the military are handed spreadsheets of potential job titles, lists of transferable skills or well-meaning advice to “network.”

What’s missing, Guggemos argues, is the grounding question: What do you actually value?

“When I was younger, my mission statement was all goals. Pay rent, hit this target, achieve these goals, buy a house in this neighborhood,” he said. “Over time, it shifted. Now it’s about values. If you don’t know your values, you’ll take a job that pays well but eats you alive; been there.”

That insight has become one of the program’s guiding principles. Veterans are encouraged not just to chase jobs, but to interrogate whether those jobs align with who they are and what they want their lives to stand for.

It’s a message that resonates because Guggemos himself has lived the structured clarity of military life and the messy ambiguity of corporate America. He knows what it’s like to leave a defined, action-oriented mission and enter a world where success is often measured in unfamiliar ways.

For Alyssa Ebers, military service meant clarity of mission and confidence in leadership. A reservist and Air Force officer, she rose to the rank of captain and served as branch chief leading a team of 20 across three different units.

“I had Navy, Army and Air Force under me,” said Ebbers, who traveled from her home in Flagstaff, Arizona, to attend the program. “We had a very distinct mission. We knew what to look for, where to look and what could affect our aircraft. It was clear, and I thrived in that environment.”

The transition to civilian life, however, has been less straightforward. Today, Ebers works as a specialist. It’s an important role, but one that feels like a step down from the leadership positions she once held.

“It seems like a very significant decrease from what I was doing,” she admitted. “I can see what I’m doing has impact, but it’s not nearly as significant. I’m not leading a team. I’m not right where I want to be, because I like leading. I like building up teams. I like projects. And right now, I’m just part of a team.”

Her first impressions of the program have been encouraging.

“It does seem like people are invested,” Ebers said. “I’ve had experience with other veteran mentorship programs where people sign up but really don’t know why they’re there. This one feels different. It seems very established, and people genuinely want to help. That’s a good sign.”

Mentor Patrick Gallagher said he’s 100% invested and wants to help people like Ebers find meaningful employment again.

“My military experience got me my job, but it didn’t give me a career,” said Gallagher, a Marine Corps veteran who now serves as one of the program’s senior mentors.

Gallagher lives in Chandler, Arizona, but works remotely as an engagement manager for TEK Systems, an IT services company based in Maryland. Gallagher has spent decades navigating the transition from military to civilian life with remarkable adaptability, which his why he has turned a lot of his focus to mentoring veterans.

It was through this work that Gallagher connected with Guggemos, whose corporate training class he initially intended to audit. Instead, he became a full participant and one of its biggest advocates.

“The training was probably the most important I’ve received in the last 20 years,” Gallagher said. For Gallagher, the experience reinforced a lesson he learned in the Marines: In order to be effective, one must understand the broader mission and the roles everyone plays in achieving it.

At its core, this class is about honesty. We’re talking honestly about who you are, what your struggles are and how the world works.

Unlike many career-transition workshops, the program doesn’t start with resumes or job boards. It starts with conversation.

Veterans sit around a table and talk about their fears, their failures, their doubts. They share stories of interviews gone wrong, of civilian bosses who couldn’t understand military jargon, of marriages strained by the stress of starting over.

The goal isn’t therapy; it’s honesty. And in that honesty, trust begins to form.

“Credibility doesn’t come from a title,” Guggemos reminds them. “It comes from the person being real about where they have been, mistakes made and doing the work to improve. There are no secrets, only awareness and work.”

Entrepreneur Zach Fuller certainly has credibility in the business world, and he is using his military experience to help other veterans.

An Army Green Beret, Fuller spent five years in the service mastering unconventional warfare and human intelligence operations, including interrogation, surveillance and countersurveillance. Today, he applies that same disciplined mindset to the cybersecurity industry, where his company, Silent Sector, provides professional services to mid-market and emerging businesses across the United States.

“The Army gave me the ability to go in and accomplish a mission regardless of what resources you have available,” he said. “Once we set a goal or an objective, we build those resources, bring the people together that we need, and execute on that objective. The same is true in entrepreneurship. You start with little to nothing and over time build multiple businesses.”

Based in Scottsdale, Arizona, Silent Sector has grown beyond its local roots, employing team members in eight states from Texas to Oregon. Even though his time is limited, he makes sure to carve time out for Guggemos’ program.

“Instead of staying tied up in your day-to-day operations, this course helps you step back, look objectively at where you can improve and focus on your career paths, strengths and weaknesses,” Fuller said. “It’s powerful to have instructors who think differently.

Jake Crown grew up surrounded by military influence, though he never wore the uniform himself. His grandfather served, and his father and uncle moved frequently as part of a military upbringing.

“Those military values and lifestyle were instilled in me growing up,” said Crown, who is a mentor in the program.

Today, he carries those lessons into his role as vice president of development at AZ Crown Investments and into his commitment to helping veterans transition into civilian life.

“The headlines around veteran suicide or the health outcomes associated with transitioning out of the military life are kind of astonishing,” he said. “I’ve always thought a lot about how to live an impactful life, and this is one of those areas where I feel I can make a difference.”

Part of that difference, Crown believes, is giving veterans tools that don’t require decades of experience, but rather the right kind of mentorship.

“There are certain skills and principles you just need to walk someone through,” Crown said. “At its core, this class is about honesty. We’re talking honestly about who you are, what your struggles are and how the world works. That honesty helps people change the way they view themselves and how they value their prior military service.”

Because he never served, Crown said he brings a slightly different perspective to the room. From his vantage point, the hardest part of the transition for veterans is redefining their identity and adjusting their mindset.

“In the military, the respect of the chain of command is instilled in you from day one,” he said. “But in the civilian world, that chain of command isn’t as rigid — or as respected. Communication is also completely different. In the service, you’re trained to get right to the point, strip out the emotion and commentary. But in business, emotion and politics aren’t avoidable, they’re required. You have to build consensus.”

It's an art form that David Thralls is still trying to perfect.

He joined the Marine Corps in 2000, when he was just 19, eager for challenge and purpose. For the next four years, he served with the Second Battalion, Fifth Marines as a mortar man, working in the fire direction control center.

The work was demanding, but it was also straightforward in its clarity. Life after the Marines, however, proved much more complicated. Thralls left the service in 2004, just a year after returning home from Iraq, where his daughter had been born while he was deployed.

“I came back, and now I had no job and a family to provide for at 24 years old,” he said. “It’s a ton of responsibility. The Marine Corps gives you lots of tools, but they don’t necessarily teach you how to translate those tools into the civilian world. I’ve always had rough edges, and that doesn’t always mesh well outside the military.”

Thralls admits his blunt style sometimes worked against him in corporate settings.

“I’m really good at handling pressure, but when my meter tops out, I don’t always articulate things the best way. That’s something I’ve had to work on.”

As he moves forward, focusing on a career in IT, Thralls is finding inspiration in the openness of his peers and mentors.

“Hearing people share their experiences makes me want to tell more of my own story,” he said. “I’ve always preferred to fly under the radar, but being around other vets — it grounds you. It reminds you we’re all figuring it out, and we can learn a lot from each other.”

Mentor Matt Silverman, who currently serves as a colonel in the United States Army Reserve, said the gap between military and civilian life isn’t about ability but language.

“Soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines don’t always have the vocabulary to explain how valuable they are,” said Silverman, who runs AIB Partners out of Madison, Wisconsin. “This program helps them build that transition.”

His perspective comes from experience. From 2004 to 2008, Silverman served on active duty, spending 15 months deployed in Iraq. That time, he says, taught him both the strengths and challenges of military life. Lessons that surface again during the transition to civilian careers.

“Everyone’s experience is different,” he acknowledged, ""but a lot of us struggle to find purpose and meaning outside of the military. Civilian organizations are structured differently, and even the basics — like finance — operate in ways we never had to think about in uniform. In the Army, there’s a budget, you spend it, then ask for more. In the civilian world, finance and accounting drive the business.”

For Silverman, mentoring isn’t an obligation; it’s a calling.

“Veterans are my people,” he said with conviction. “Anything I can do to help them in a meaningful way brings joy to my life. I’ll go out of my way to do that whenever I can.”

Arizona State University will pay special tribute to Vietnam veterans and their families during this year’s Salute to Service, taking place Nov. 7–16.

In addition to honoring all who have served in the military and their communities, ASU is commemorating the 50th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War with a “welcome home” for its veterans.  

Over a dozen events are scheduled across ASU’s Phoenix metro campuses, including the Salute to Service football game against West Virginia, which will also be the Sun Devil’s Homecoming game.

“Salute to Service coinciding with Homecoming makes this year’s celebration extra special,” said Michelle Loposky, Salute to Service committee chair and strategic partnerships director with the Pat Tillman Veterans Center. “It’s truly a blend of the two, a homecoming for our Sun Devil family and for our Vietnam veterans.”

Welcoming home Vietnam veterans is a great idea and long overdue, said alum Andy Gilb, who served on active duty as an Army officer after completing ROTC at ASU and graduating in 1973.

“Although I never did a tour in Vietnam, most of the non-commissioned officers I served with had done multiple tours,” Gilb said. “I greatly respected them for their sacrifices and strong leadership.

“ASU recognizing Vietnam veterans, or any veterans, is outstanding. It’s the right thing to do. Those veterans did their job, served their time, and to have that remembrance in their honor is impressive.”

ASU is home to over 20,000 military-connected learners, including veterans, active duty members, Guard, reservists and military family members. The Pat Tillman Veterans Center helps military students transition to academic life, while offering programs and opportunities to grow and prepare for life after graduation. 

Throughout Salute to Service, ASU will host a wide range of events recognizing military service and community impact, from panel discussions, book talks and film screenings to health exhibits, concerts and family activities. Students, faculty, alumni and the public are invited to participate in experiences that highlight service and honor those who have served the nation and their communities.

Water shortages are impacting Colorado River basin reservoirs such as Lake Mead in Nevada and Lake Powell, which stretches across northern Arizona and southern Utah.

Arizona is about to enter a new era when it comes to water rights and distribution.

The state’s main source of surface water — the Colorado River — has been dwindling as a result of climate change and increased water demand.

That means less water for approximately 40 million people in two countries, seven states and 30 Native American tribes. And the rules that govern how states face water cuts are set to expire on Dec. 31, 2026.

The seven states involved have struggled to reach an agreement regarding the future of these cuts. But whatever the outcome may be of negotiations or potential litigation between these seven states, experts say that Valley residents face significant water risks, including:

One Arizona State University expert says not to panic but be prepared to open your wallet.

Rhett Larson, the Richard Morrison Professor of Water Law at ASU’s Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law, estimates water prices could significantly increase in some parts of the Valley if Arizona cannot come to an equitable and sustainable agreement with the other six states on how to share in decreased flows of the Colorado River.

“Arizona is not running out of water. We are running out of cheap water,” said Larson, who is also a senior research fellow with the Kyl Center for Water Policy at ASU's Morrison Institute for Public Policy. “This means not just higher water rates, but also difficult choices on economic trade-offs — for example, higher food prices due to less water for agriculture but lower housing prices with more water for residential growth.”

ASU News spoke to several water policy scholars to get a behind-the-scenes look at how the seven states are working together on the new agreement, what are some viable options in case of a shortfall, and what Arizona’s future looks like when it comes to its most precious resource.

Over the past century, the Colorado River's flow has declined by about 20%. With rising temperatures and declining Rocky Mountain snowpack, scientists have predicted flow reductions of up to 30% by mid-century.

The seven states within the Colorado River basin are under increasing pressure to develop long-term management strategies, as the existing agreements are set to expire at the end of 2026. A significant challenge lies in managing the persistent drought while balancing the requirements of stakeholders, including agricultural interests, urban water consumers, environmental needs and Indigenous rights holders.

In response to a prolonged drought, diminishing storage capacities and increasing demands for Colorado River water, the secretary of the interior issued a directive in May 2005 for reclamation to formulate enhanced strategies aimed at optimizing the coordinated management of the reservoirs within the Colorado River system.

On April 23, 2007, all seven states signed an interim agreement that memorialized the consensus recommendation to the secretary. Those rules have remained in place for the last 18 years, but the flow of recent events demand dramatic action.

“There’s no way that this ends without lower water supplies in Arizona,” Larson said. “Even the best-case scenario means that Arizona will have to make do with less water.”

However, Larson said there’s been progress as of late. He said there is a proposal on the table where the upper basin states would shift the way the water is measured to align more closely with reality.

“There have been some promising breakthroughs, but it could also collapse into litigation,” said Larson.

In addition to his roles at ASU, Larson is also an attorney for the Arizona Municipal Water Users Association, serves on Arizona’s Water Infrastructure Finance Authority Water Conservation Grant Fund Committee and sits on the board of directors of the Arizona-Mexico Commission.

“There’s a decent chance the states of the basin will sue each other in the United States Supreme Court, and who knows how that will play out?” he said.

If the seven Colorado River basin states can’t come to an agreement by the deadline, Arizona does have other water options. Some are legal, some are logistical and some are long shots. And they all come with a price tag.

“Trends are pointing to the fact that the Colorado River is becoming drier and I think it would be safe to say that the Central Arizona Project won’t be as large a provider of water as at present,” said Enrique Vivoni, ASU’s Fulton Professor of Hydrosystems Engineering in the School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment and the director of the Center for Hydrologic Innovations. “So, if that’s the case, it means Arizona will have to start thinking about replacing that water supply. That would require investments.”

Vivoni, whose research focuses on hydrology and water resources, said Arizona has several water augmentation options at its disposal. They include groundwater extraction, water desalination, reservoir expansion, wastewater reclamation and interbasin transfers from other areas.

All these options require complex agreements and investments.

For example, Vivoni said groundwater extraction would require major investment in infrastructure, such as new wells and pipelines to bring water supplies to existing systems. The desalination option could involve paying to build a plant in Mexico in exchange for a portion of their Colorado River water. Expansion of Arizona’s Bartlett Reservoir capacity will require raising the dam to retain more Verde River water.

“All of these options require capital expenses and large operations and maintenance costs on an annual basis,” Vivoni said. “It’s going to require some hard choices. There will be some winners and some losers, and it’s going to require some behavioral changes by individuals, residents, communities, industry and cities.”

In addition to the costs of tapping groundwater, ASU researchers recently reported that the state’s unseen groundwater losses have been great as well.

Karem Abdelmohsen, Jay Famiglietti and colleagues used orbiting satellites to measure changes in groundwater from 2002 to 2024 in the Colorado River basin, in comparison to losses in streamflow and reservoir storage.

The satellite study found that groundwater depletion accounted for more than half of the total water storage loss in the upper Colorado River basin and more than two-thirds of losses in the lower Colorado River basin, which is greater than the losses in lakes Powell and Mead.

“The rate of depletion has actually accelerated over the last decade,” said Famiglietti, science director for ASU’s Arizona Water Innovation Initiative.

With less access to water from the Colorado River, demand for groundwater will grow. Famiglietti said that the effectiveness of groundwater management varies across the Colorado River basin states, leaving the resource open to overexploitation.

If the seven states don’t come to an agreement soon, one possible scenario is that the secretary of the interior would make unilateral decisions on cuts and deliveries. Such actions would likely lead to lawsuits challenging the secretary’s authority to do so.

“Not having a consensus agreement in place means we could go from relative certainty about the conditions of shortage to total uncertainty,” said Kathryn Sorensen, who oversees the research efforts of the Kyl Center for Water Policy, serves as a professor of practice at the Watts College of Public Service and Community Solutions and contributes to the Global Futures Laboratory. “What we don’t want is someone making those decisions for us.”

That lack of certainty could lead to many drawbacks, according to Sarah Porter, director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy.

“Being in the dark about this situation could lead to higher (water) prices,” Porter said. “It could also lead to a disruption in economic development and the state’s prosperity. Not having clarity regarding how much water will be available over the long term could impact the state’s ability to attract industry. If there’s too much uncertainty about our long-term water supplies, then we’re not a good bet for investment.”

But water scarcity is not a new issue for Arizona. The state has a history of managing limited resources for collective benefit.

And that’s reason for hope as the state faces these current challenges.

“If you look at the history of water management in the Phoenix area, it’s a story of adaptation and overcoming obstacles and finding ways to be innovative,” Sorensen said. “We know how to do more with less, and we’re good at it.”

We’re also good at problem-solving and finding solutions, Porter said.

“I’m very optimistic about our water future because we’ve had over 100 years as a seven-state basin to figure out solutions,” Porter said. “I’m also optimistic because I’ve seen how creative and dedicated Arizona municipal water managers are — they’re resourceful, prepared and have their short- and long-term plans in place.

“I think there’s going to be water to help us enjoy a good quality of life and a thriving economy for central Arizona for a long time.”

When it comes to organization, even cells have their own preferred system.

While genetic engineers can design and assemble sophisticated gene circuits to program cells with new functions, as these cells then grow and divide, important signaling molecules can become diluted, causing synthetic gene circuits to lose the new function.

Xiaojun Tian, an associate professor in the School of Biological and Health Systems Engineering, part of the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at ASU, and his team have discovered a way to protect those fragile genetic programs using a principle borrowed straight from nature.

The project is powered by interdisciplinary expertise in synthetic biology, modeling and metabolic engineering, as provided by David Nielsen, a chemical engineering professor in the School for Engineering of Matter, Transport and Energy, part of the Fulton Schools, and Wenwei Zheng, an associate professor of chemistry in the School of Applied Sciences and Arts, part of the College of Integrative Sciences and Arts at Arizona State University.

In a recent paper published in Cell, the researchers outlined a technique that can stabilize synthetic gene circuits by forming small, droplet-like compartments inside cells through a process called liquid-liquid phase separation.

These microscopic droplets, called transcriptional condensates, act like molecular safe zones around key genes, shielding synthetically engineered modifications from being washed away by the tide of cell growth.

“When we try to program cells to perform useful tasks, such as diagnostics or therapeutic production, the genetic programs often fail because cell growth dilutes the key molecules needed to keep them running,” Tian says. “We addressed this challenge by tapping into the cell’s own strategy of phase separation to protect engineered systems.”

Cells use phase separation to organize their inner environment, creating compartments for essential biochemical reactions without the use of membranes. Tian’s team realized that by engineering similar condensates around synthetic genes, they could mimic this natural organization and maintain genetic stability across various cell generations.

“We discovered that by forming tiny droplets called transcriptional condensates around genes, we can protect genetic programs and keep them stable even as cells grow,” Zheng says. “It’s a simple physical solution that prevents dilution and keeps circuits running reliably.”

This approach represents a major shift from traditional strategies in synthetic biology, which have largely focused on tweaking DNA sequences or regulatory feedback loops to keep engineered systems functioning.

Instead of more complex control systems, Tian’s team introduced a physical design principle that leverages the existing spatial organization of molecules inside cells.

While natural cells have evolved to use condensates as a built-in protective system for regulating gene circuit activity, this study is among the first to show how it can be repurposed to stabilize synthetic programs.

“Cells already use these droplets to regulate themselves,” Tian says. “We’re now harnessing the same strategy for synthetic biology.”

Adopting this methodology could help researchers build more reliable biological systems that maintain predictable, productive functions.

“This opens a new way to build more reliable living systems, from stable cell factories to future medical applications,” Tian says. “Our strategy can become a new design principle for researchers who need their engineered cells to work consistently.”

Images taken via microscope from the study show bright, glowing clusters of transcriptional condensates inside cells, which serve as visual proof that droplets can form precisely where needed to stabilize gene activity.

“It’s exciting to see how these droplets can be used to boost bioproduction yields,” Nielsen says. “This kind of collaboration bridges fundamental biological insights with real metabolic engineering applications.”

Tian’s group is already exploring how to engineer different kinds of condensates to control different genes, effectively turning them into programmable control hubs inside cells.

“We want to program different condensates to control different genes, creating smart cells that can adapt and function long term,” he says. “We’re learning how to design with the cell, not against it.”

This approach to designing in accordance with nature rather than trying to override it represents a key turning point in the field. The next step is to demonstrate the technique’s applications for more diverse implementations to determine resilience and scalability, though researchers see no shortage in potential applications.

“Researchers in synthetic biology who struggle with unstable circuits will see this as a new way to make their systems more reliable,” Zheng says. “Bioprocess engineers who want a consistent yield can also use it. For biophysicists like me, it’s exciting to see physical principles like phase separation turned into practical engineering tools.”

“This work reflects a new direction in synthetic biology,” Tian says. “By using the cell’s own organizing principles, we can build systems that are both powerful and inherently stable.”

From his third-floor office at Arizona State University, floor-length windows give Sethuraman Panchanathan a stunning panorama of the sprawling Tempe campus.

But the view is not new to Panchanathan, Professor of Technology and Innovation and former director of the National Science Foundation.

Before becoming director of the National Science Foundation in 2020, he worked at ASU for 22 years, where he created the Center for Cognitive Ubiquitous Computing, founded the School of Computing and Informatics and the Department of Biomedical Informatics, and served as the executive vice president of ASU’s Knowledge Enterprise and the chief research and innovation officer. 

But it’s not the past that has brought Panchanathan back. It’s the future, and the trajectory that he and ASU share: the absolute belief and unwavering certainty that research matters.

“I’m very passionate about that from a personal perspective, from my own research interests and the amazing opportunities that are in front of us to unleash innovation and talent for global good,” said Panchanathan, who also is a prolific inventor with several patents and copyrights, and a writer with nearly 500 published papers in journals and conferences.

As director of the NSF, Panchanathan says his main focus was “to ensure that innovation thrives everywhere across our country, thereby leading to opportunities for everyone.”

He envisioned and launched the new Technology, Innovation and Partnerships Directorate, the first new directorate in 31 years at NSF, which leverages and energizes fundamental discoveries to supercharge in-place innovation throughout the country. He launched the GRANTED program, which ensures that all institutions are capable of translating their ideas into successful funded projects, and launched a global centers program with several projects focused on addressing shared global challenges with like-minded international partners.

Also during his tenure at NSF, emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum biotechnology, advanced manufacturing and next-gen wireless were strengthened and accelerated. For example, under his leadership, NSF launched 27 AI institutes that focused on agriculture, weather, learning, advanced materials and astronomical sciences. These institutes span the country with NSF and partnership investments exceeding half a billion dollars.

He also oversaw the development of the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource Pilot, an access point for researchers and educators to advance research ideas in AI and train the next generation of AI talent.

“Typically, frontier infrastructure is only available in industry,” Panchanathan said. “It’s pretty expensive, and in some cases it’s also complex in terms of converging all of that for research and development. We therefore wanted to democratize access by bringing in partners, co-investing and making that available for researchers and students in various universities and community colleges so they can advance their ideas in AI.”

Panchanathan said that what he did nationally while at NSF mirrors what he did at ASU, regionally and locally, with enterprises like SkySong and MacroTechnology Works, which serve as labs, fostering collaborations with industry partners and startups.

ASU President Michael Crow said the university is excited to welcome back Panchanathan as he blazes new trails in AI, quantum, semiconductors and health care.

“Panch and I have worked together for more than two decades to make ASU a pioneer in use-inspired research and to prepare our nation’s future innovation leaders,” Crow said. “Panch’s vision, energy and global engagements were integral to ASU becoming a force in science and technology.”

Panchanathan said that in the next five years, ASU can be at the forefront of setting the groundwork for a model AI university/learning enterprise.

“I don’t even want to use the word university because that gives a connotation that somehow it’s about four-year degree programs and master’s degrees and PhDs and so on,” he said. “It’s about how an AI enterprise can be built that can completely transform how people learn, live and contribute. Such an enterprise should advance AI literacy, AI competency and AI expertise.”

Another of Panchanathan’s goals for the university is continuing to strengthen the educational partnerships between ASU and India. ASU is the top university home in the U.S. for students from India, and its Indian alumni network exceeds 12,600 alumni.

“The oldest democracy and the largest democracy working together can pioneer new models of discovery and learning that ensure good quality of life and prosperity for all at speed and scale,” said Panchanathan, who in May was awarded the Padma Shri, a symbol of national gratitude in India that is awarded for excellence in the fields of art, education, industry, science, medicine, social service and public affairs.

“Our students here and our research partnerships with industry in both nations is something that can continue to enrich students and set the stage for the future.” 

Panchanathan said his immediate mission is to continue the work he did at the NSF in advocating for the importance of science and technology to American competitiveness.

“I’m a huge fan of democratization of talent, and ideas all across the country being energized, inspired, motivated, nurtured and brought to life,” he said. “This will guarantee that we, as a nation, can outcompete by out-innovating.”

Arizona State University alumnus Dylan Park-Pettiford has spent most of his life caught between worlds.

Born in the Bay Area to a Black father and a Korean mother, he learned early how belonging could shift depending on who was asking. At home, his parents filled the air with Coltrane and kimchi, jazz records and Korean news. The house felt like a bridge between cultures. But outside, the world was less forgiving.

“Being biracial showed me two sides of life,” Park-Pettiford said. “But it also meant never fully belonging to either.”

That early fracture became a lens through which he saw everything. He ended up joining the military looking for purpose, and what he found instead were contradictions as deep as the ones inside himself.

Years later, that search for meaning and the long, uneven road that followed brings Park-Pettiford back to Arizona State University, where he will share the story of how war, loss and a lifetime between identities shaped the man he became.

Park-Pettiford will be visiting ASU for the first time in almost 15 years, attending an ASU Book Group event for his memoir, ""Roadside,"" as part of Salute to Service.

For Park-Pettiford, this homecoming is layered. He’s come back not just to read from his new memoir but to retrace the long and uneven road that brought him here.

At 39, Park-Pettiford carries the mix of calm and unease that marks men who have lived several lives. He’s a father and screenwriter now, with several projects in development in the Los Angeles area. There is a quiet gravity that settles in his voice when he talks about the past.

“Coming back to Arizona will feel like closing a circle,” he said. “I first came to ASU right after Iraq, when I was still trying to figure out who I was. I didn’t realize then how much I was still carrying.”

But the journey to this moment began long before the desert, before Hollywood, before the uniform. 

Growing up in what Park-Pettiford called “a very worldly household,” he says his parents raised him without much talk of race, despite their racial differences.

“I didn’t really think about being biracial until we moved to Texas,” he said. “That’s when I started to understand what racism felt like.”

At Black family cookouts, he was the odd one out; among Korean relatives, he couldn’t follow the language.

“That upbringing taught me not to hold prejudice,” he said. “But it also showed me how deeply people can hold onto theirs.”

The complexity of identity would become one of Park-Pettiford’s lifelong themes, and is explored later in his writing, his filmmaking and even his service. 

After high school, Park-Pettiford watched friends funnel into tech startups and dot-com jobs, coding and commuting, and living lives that looked nothing like his. He knew he didn’t want to sit in a cubicle. He wanted to see and experience what the world had to offer.

Then when the 9/11 attacks occurred in 2001, that desire collided with something larger.

“Pat Tillman’s story really hit me,” Park-Pettiford said, referencing the former ASU football star who left the NFL to enlist. “He gave up everything for service. I was young, idealistic. I thought, maybe that’s how I find purpose.”

After attending Tillman’s memorial service in April 2004 at the San Jose Municipal Rose Garden near his home, Park-Pettiford walked into an Air Force recruiting office and enlisted. But instead of finding what he was looking for, he found more contradictions.

“The military is America in miniature,” he said. “All its strengths and all its faults.”

He says he experienced some of the worst racism of his life in uniform.

“A lot of guys came from small towns and carried those ideas with them,” he explained. “Sometimes I’d hope being around me might change their prejudices. Other times, it was clear it wouldn’t.”

Still, when the bullets started flying, those divisions blurred.

“In combat, it didn’t matter what color you were,” he said. “You just wanted to stay alive.”

In Iraq, he also met Brahim, a teenage interpreter whose easy humor reminded him of his younger brother, Rory.

“He made me realize how normal people there were,” said Park-Pettiford, who was assigned to the U.S. Air Force Special Operations unit. “They had families, pets, favorite songs. Before deployment, we were fed this cartoon version of Iraq. Meeting Brahim shattered that. It also made me question why we were there at all.”

Those contradictions haunted him: the brotherhood and the bias, the purpose and the destruction. They would become central to his book, which is not only a portrait of war, but of the moral fog that lingers long after.

After leaving the military, Park-Pettiford enrolled in ASU. He majored in film and media studies and graduated in 2011. He said his time here gave him structure, a schedule and a purpose beyond survival.

By the time he left Tempe, Park-Pettiford had direction. For a while, it worked. Then life came apart again.

His younger brother, Rory, was fatally shot outside of a San Jose, California, convenience store in November 2012. It became a defining loss of Park-Pettiford’s life.

“That loss broke me,” he said. “It made me realize that pain doesn’t have to be on a battlefield to be devastating.""

“When we were kids, I used to resent having to take him everywhere,” Park-Pettiford admitted. “I wanted independence. After I joined the military, I’d come home to strangers telling me how much my brother would talk about me. That’s when I realized how much he looked up to me.”

“I learned loyalty too late,” Park-Pettiford said, quietly. “That was a hard lesson.”

He also experienced a divorce, homelessness and struggled with alcohol.

Those nights on the street weren’t new. As a teenager, he’d run away to escape abuse at home and learned the geography of public parks by heart. He credits that time for his resilience.

“I’ve slept on park benches before,” he said. “I knew how to survive. But it’s different when you’re supposed to be an adult.”

To keep from breaking further, Park-Pettiford started writing. In Iraq, he kept a journal because he was bored. After he got out of the military, his journal became therapy.

Park-Pettiford filled notebooks with fragments of memories, jokes, nightmares and conversations with ghosts. But as the pages piled up, he noticed a rhythm, a voice and a story taking shape. Not just his, but one a lot of people could relate to.

When a literary agent got hold of a few entries and suggested he turn them into a book, Park-Pettiford resisted. He felt it was too personal and raw.

Eventually, he agreed — not because he wanted to tell his story, but because he thought it might help others tell theirs. The result was “Roadside: My Journey to Iraq and the Long Road Home,” published by Chicago Review Press in June 2025.

The book is an unflinching chronicle of trauma, guilt and the absurdity of war, laced with gallows humor and flashes of tenderness. It’s also a portrait of survival, both literal and emotional. It’s a coming-of-age story, where a lot of the young men around him didn’t live long enough to see their adult years.

“I wanted it to sound like how people actually talk,” he said. “Not like a history book or a lecture. I wanted honesty.”

Readers responded. Veterans reached out, thanking him for saying the things they couldn’t. Civilians found empathy in his descriptions of displacement and loss. His performances for The Moth, a famed storytelling series, drew standing ovations.

“People would come up after and tell me their stories,” he said. “That connection helped more than anything else.”

He credits humor as his most reliable armor.

“The book’s dark, but it’s also funny,” he said. “Because that’s how we survive. If you can laugh, you can live.”

By then, he had moved to Los Angeles to chase a career in film and television. The early years were pure hustle: script work, part-time jobs, rooms rented from strangers. The chaos was somewhat familiar.

“LA’s a lot like the military,” he said. “You’re surrounded by characters, some dangerous, some brilliant. You just try to survive and keep your humor intact.”

He began writing scripts while developing “Roadside,” eventually landing jobs in writers’ rooms, including a spinoff for “Bosch.” But Hollywood, like war, comes with its own contradictions.

“It’s a place where people will use you to get ahead,” Park-Pettiford said. “But it’s also a place where art can heal people.”

He's currently developing a series with playwright and television writer Rick Cleveland (“Six Feet Under” and “The West Wing""), with Academy Award-winning actress Halle Berry attached. Another project, a military horror feature film, is being penned for a producer of the hit Netflix series “Black Rabbit.” The work is steady, but it’s not what drives him.

“At this point, success isn’t money or fame,” he says. “It’s being able to tell the stories that matter … and being able to go home and hold my daughter.”

His daughter, Story, is now a year old and carries her own legacy. Her name is a bridge between past and future.

“She’s named partly for Rory and partly for what I do now,” Park-Pettiford said. “Story is what saved me. I’ve never felt more at home.”

That resilience and quiet refusal to quit is what defines him now. It’s the through line from Iraq to ASU, from park benches to film sets.

When asked what he hopes readers take from “Roadside,” he answers without hesitation.

“A glimmer of hope,” he says. “The reunion with Brahim was mine. Even in the worst circumstances, there’s something that helps you survive. It could be humor, faith, friendship, whatever it is. There can always be better days ahead.”

That message resonates especially at ASU’s Salute to Service, where the university honors the varied, complicated experiences of those who serve. For Park-Pettiford, returning here isn’t just a speaking engagement. It’s both a reckoning and a reconciliation.

“I came here after Iraq because I needed structure,” he said. “Now I’m coming back because I finally have one. ASU is where I started figuring out who I was after the military. Coming back here feels like proof that the road actually leads somewhere.”

Editor's note: ASU is celebrating Salute to Service Nov. 7–16, which honors individuals and their families who put service above self in both their professional and personal lives.

This fall at Arizona State University's West Valley campus, a new communication course is teaching students that storytelling can do more than inform — it can preserve history, strengthen family bonds and give veterans a lasting voice.

COM 294 – Living History: Communicating Veteran Stories, taught by Instructor Trinity Winton in the School of Social and Behavioral Sciences, launched in partnership with Imprints of Honor, a nonprofit dedicated to documenting veterans’ lived experiences. 

ASU hosts 'welcome home' tribute for Vietnam veterans during Salute to Service

As part of the course, students interview a veteran, write and publish their story in an online volume and have the story archived in the Library of Congress — turning classroom work into permanent records of American history.

For W. P. Carey School of Business student Kayla Burns, the assignment became deeply personal.

“This class is very important to me because the military has been such a big part of my family’s history,” Burns said. “Telling my grandfather’s story has changed my life;it brought us closer and helped me understand his service in a way I never had before.”

Kayla’s grandfather, George Burns, now 85, served in the U.S. Navy for 21 years and worked on navigational and optical equipment, including binoculars, periscopes and the instruments that kept ships running.Through the interview process, Kayla discovered how the discipline and exacting standards of naval life shaped him.

“Everything had to be clean, neat and precise,” she said. “Even as a kid at his house, everything had a place. I always thought grandpa was just strict, but learning about the rules and procedures he followed in the optical room made me understand why he was that way.”

Those technical details revealed character traits other family stories had never explained: lifelong attention to detail, a drive to set and meet goals, and a belief that steady effort and skill matter. Kayla says the process also made room for surprising tenderness.

“He came alive when we talked about the technical stuff,” she said. “Seeing him remember and explain those details, you could tell it meant a lot to him. I think there was real healing in that.”

Winton created the course to pair civic engagement with empathy-driven communication. Winton, whose husband is an Air Force veteran, sees the project as a way to preserve the complexity of veterans’ lives: the pride, the routines and the deep reflections that often follow service.

“There’s so much civilians don’t know about what military life is like — the beautiful, the challenging and the heartbreaking,” Winton said. “If we lose those voices, we lose their lessons. This class gives students the opportunity to preserve those stories for future generations.”

Beyond developing interviewing and writing skills, the course cultivates civic literacy, compassion and a sense of shared responsibility. Veterans receive the validation that their service and memories matter; students learn the ethics and craft of listening well.

Kayla describes how the project deepened family conversations. Her father joined her for the interview sessions, and the family has since talked openly about military life in ways they hadn’t before.

“Preserving his story has really strengthened our bonds,” Burns said. “We’re embracing that history more; it’s deepening my connection to my grandfather.”

Not all memories were easy to access. Kayla found that some topics were off-limits; but the moments of vulnerability that did surface were powerful, particularly when George reflected on the bitter reception many Vietnam-era veterans faced after returning home.

Kayla also hopes readers will notice the often-overlooked roles in military history. Her grandfather’s work in the optical room, the hands-on maintenance and precision, may not make headlines, but it kept crews and ships safe and effective.

“I want people to remember the value of the ‘little guys’ who keep the whole machine running,” she said. “Without every cog, the machine won’t work.”

COM 294’s partnership with Imprints of Honor and the Library of Congress ensures these narratives reach beyond the classroom. Student interviews become part of a national archive, accessible to researchers, family members and future generations seeking to understand the everyday realities of service.

“Humans are storytelling creatures,” Winton said. “It’s our duty to listen, learn and make sure these memories are never lost.”

Red is the color that best embodies the range of energetic expression in toddlers, and that’s why Amanda Pintore named her family-friendly dance performance “Red.”

“This is for 12- to 36-month-olds, so we’re exploring joyful chaos, rough-and-tumble play, connection making and expression,” said Pintore, an assistant professor in the School of Music, Dance and Theatre at Arizona State University.

“Red” is an interactive performance for toddlers and their families, who all dance together with Pintore. The show debuted Oct. 30 and runs through Nov. 9 at Mesa Arts Center, with several performances scheduled after that at the Children’s Museum of Phoenix.

Pintore earned her MFA in youth theater at ASU in 2017, and her thesis explored how to collaborate with very young children and their family members in the dance process.

“It was not just thinking about them as audience members, but as co-artists,” she said.

She then worked as associate director of performing arts and education at the Lawrence Arts Center in Kansas and won a grant to further explore the discipline of theater dance for young children, working with them at universities, arts organizations, libraries and community spaces.

She developed a methodology, which she calls a “play lab,” for conducting research with young children and then using the results to create a performance, usually with a team of researcher-performers.

“At first, we make as few decisions as possible about the show. Usually we have a hunch, a core idea,” she said.

Then they have a structured series of play labs with children, and sometimes also the caregivers, in which the performer-researchers follow the lead of the little ones.

The session is recorded, and Pintore has a system for assigning codes to various outcomes during the session — actions like jumping or spinning, the energy level in the room, whether the participants are playing together, what is said. Then she looks for themes in the codes to further shape a concept. The performer-researchers rehearse to create a performance, return to the play lab to workshop it and then rehearse some more.

An interactive dance performance with toddlers potentially could be hectic, but Amanda Pintore (front) said the hours of research help the performer-researchers anticipate everything that might happen. “There’s a pretty big range of participation, observation and activation in this age range. And we are trained to handle whatever happens in the room,” she said. They also help prepare the participants with a pre-show talk and at the end help them transition back into their day.

Pintore also bases the performances on the intended participants. When she works with preschools, there could be up to 20 children.

“This is their space. This is a different kind of energy. I always say to people, ‘I have a really high capacity for chaos because there's a lot that goes into the mix there.’”

When she works with families, the groups are smaller.

“We never work with more than seven family units at a time because we have bigger bodies in space,” she said. “Red” will have 25 total participants.

Her research led to her recent book, “Theatre and Dance with Children as Artistic Partners: Devising Performance for the Very Young,” which describes her play lab framework for creating a performance (along with tips, like delegating some of the time-consuming coding).

She also teaches a course on how to create theater dance for young children that collaborates with the Child Development Lab preschool on campus.

An interactive dance performance with toddlers potentially could be hectic, but Pintore said the hours of research help the performer-researchers anticipate everything that might happen.

“There’s a pretty big range of participation, observation and activation in this age range. And we are trained to handle whatever happens in the room,” she said.

They also prepare the participants, starting with a pre-show chat.

“There will be babies who are going to stay in that seat the whole time because they're in an observation space. And children can move freely in and out of the central playing space with us.”

Olivia Herneddo, a lead experience designer for ASU Enterprise Technology, is the other dancer-researcher along with Pintore for the performances of “Red.” The digital musical score is by Ji Sun Myung, an instructional specialist in the School of Music, Dance and Theatre, who will improvise part of the performance.

“She is going to be not only playing live music that we have built for the show, but we also have open sections with no planned choreography where we just will see what's happening in the room and she will play with us,” Pintore said.

At the end of “Red,” which lasts 35 minutes, the researchers help families transition back into their day.

“We want caregivers to feel comfortable watching their child in this experience, having this moment together,” she said.

“What's most beautiful is seeing the child-caregiver connection and then watching children connect with their peers that they've never met before.”

For the fourth consecutive year, Thunderbird School of Global Management at Arizona State University has been recognized as the world leader in international trade by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS), the prestigious global authority on higher education rankings.

This year’s QS International Trade Rankings (2026) for MBA and master’s programs once again position Thunderbird as the No. 1 school in the world. The school ranks ahead of Columbia University, the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor (Ross) and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Kenan-Flagler) in the U.S., as well as the University of Cambridge, the University of Oxford and the National University of Singapore internationally.

“We are deeply honored to once again be recognized as the world’s top institution for international trade,” said Charla Griffy-Brown, director general and dean of Thunderbird. “Earning this distinction repeatedly among the world’s leading MBA and master’s programs underscores our unwavering commitment to preparing future-ready global leaders in one of the most dynamic and comprehensive fields of study.”

Thunderbird earned an overall score of 100 out of 100 points — ranking first among nearly 110 universities and business schools worldwide offering graduate programs in international trade. This achievement reaffirms the school’s position as a global leader in impact, innovation and academic excellence. Notably, Thunderbird is one of only three institutions to exceed the 90-point mark, with the next highest-ranked school, the National University of Singapore, following at 92.6 points — further underscoring Thunderbird’s preeminence in international trade education.

In this year’s rankings, Thunderbird once again stands as the only school from the United States — and the entire Americas — ranked among the global top 10, with Columbia University following at No. 11. The school likewise held this distinction in 2025 and, in 2024, was one of only five U.S. universities to reach the top 10.

This is also the only global No. 1 subject ranking across all of Arizona State University, highlighting Thunderbird’s distinct global impact within ASU’s world-class ecosystem.

Thunderbird’s world-class faculty are central to this recognition. They actively participate in many of the world’s leading academic and industry organizations, including the Academy of International Business, Council on Foreign Relations, Global Network of Business Schools, International Studies Association, United Nations Global Compact, and numerous World Economic Forum councils. Locally, faculty and students are engaged with the Arizona District Export Council, the Diplomatic Corps of Arizona, the Phoenix Council on Foreign Relations, and other key regional organizations.

Thunderbird faculty are also regularly featured and cited in leading international outlets, contributing scholarship and policy insights that shape global discourse. Their work has informed the strategies of prominent global institutions and has been referenced at the highest levels of policymaking. Influential bodies such as the United States International Trade Commission, the National Intelligence Council, the United States Senate, and the Departments of State and Defense have drawn upon this research — reinforcing Thunderbird’s impact in shaping international trade policy.

“I have the pleasure of seeing our incredible faculty and staff delivering a level of expertise and global perspective — and at a pace and scale — that is simply unmatched,” said Lena Booth, deputy dean of Thunderbird Academic Enterprise and finance professor at Thunderbird. “It’s proof that our students leave us ready to shape the future. They emerge confident, globally minded and equipped to lead and make a real impact wherever their careers take them.”

Developed in collaboration with the Hinrich Foundation, schools are evaluated across several key performance indicators, including trade program content, graduate outcomes, industry engagement, innovative teaching, reputation, research and program delivery. The QS rankings specifically highlight Thunderbird’s flagship Master of Global Management (MGM) program as the premier graduate program in international trade.

Kim Phuc, who was immortalized as the “napalm girl” as a child, in a photo taken during the Vietnam War, shared the life lessons she learned from her lifelong journey of healing during the kickoff talk for ASU's Wrigley Lecture Series on Thursday, Oct. 30, at the Walton Center for Planetary Health on the Tempe campus.

Before she became a symbol of warfare, Kim Phuc was just a little girl from a Vietnamese village — until fire fell from the sky. On that day, more than 50 years ago, Kim Phuc became an unwilling figure of the Vietnam War. 

In 1972, the 9-year-old was photographed running through the streets of her village after being severely burned by a military napalm attack, the terrified expression on her face an indelible reminder of war's atrocities.

“For most of the world, my story begins not with a birth certificate or a childhood memory, but with a bomb — and a photograph,” Phuc said to a crowded auditorium at the Rob and Melani Walton Center for Planetary Health on Thursday, Oct. 30, on Arizona State University’s Tempe campus. “I almost died many times. And yet, I didn’t die. That’s why I’m here with you today. Somehow, I survived.

“I survived because of one unwavering choice: the determination to live.”

Her talk, “From Scars to Strength: the Unforgettable Journey of Kim Phuc” — a powerful story of survival and resilience — was this year’s Wrigley Lecture Series kickoff.

“The Wrigley Lecture Series brings leading thinkers and problem-solvers to ASU to speak about the world’s most pressing challenges and to help us imagine a future in which all life can thrive on a healthy planet,” said Peter Schlosser, vice president and vice provost of global futures and director of the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Futures Laboratory. “Kim’s story reflects the work we pursue here every day — the belief that healing our planet begins with healing ourselves and our relationships with one another, so the choices we make today expand what’s possible for generations to come.”

Before the world knew her name, Phuc said her childhood in the village of Trang Bang was gentle, simple and filled with laughter. She rode her bicycle to school, played tag with friends and spent hours helping her mother, who ran the most popular noodle restaurant in town. Their home was surrounded by fruit trees and the hum of animals in the yard.

“For nine years,” she told a spellbound audience, “I felt completely protected.”

The security of Phuc’s childhood shattered on June 8, 1972.

That morning, fighting between North and South Vietnamese forces erupted around Trang Bang. Phuc and her family fled their home and sought shelter in a nearby temple.

“For the first time in my young life, I knew absolute, paralyzing fear,” she recalled.

Moments later, South Vietnamese planes roared overhead. In the confusion, pilots mistook the temple for an enemy base and dropped napalm. The explosions tore through the air and engulfed everything in sight.

Phuc’s clothes were burned away instantly. Her skin began to melt. Screaming, she ran down Trang Bang’s Route 1, her arms outstretched, crying for help.

That moment was captured in a photograph, published around the world and became one of the most searing images of the Vietnam War.

But while the image became a symbol, few knew the life that continued beyond it.

When her parents found her three days later, Phuc was lying in a morgue. The doctors had done what they could and assumed she would die from her burns, which covered more than half her body. But one doctor, a family friend, intervened and arranged her transfer to a burn clinic in SaigonSaigon officially changed its name to Ho Chi Minh City on July 2, 1976, after the fall of Saigon in 1975 and the reunification of Vietnam..

Phuc spent 14 months in the hospital and endured 17 surgeries, the last one in Germany.

“The pain was unbelievable,” she said. “And yet, I didn’t die.”

For years, her recovery defined her existence. Phuc had to relearn everything. That included how to walk, move and live in a body forever changed. Her skin was tight, raw and scarred. When she returned home, her family became her caregivers.

“My siblings and cousins would massage and stretch me every day, forcing the blood to flow so my body could heal,” she said. It was painful, sometimes unbearable. Her mother, who had already lost her home and livelihood, was relentless.

“She would tell me, ‘Kim, please don’t cry, because it makes me cry. If you don’t want to be disabled, you must do the exercises.’”

Phuc called it tough love.

“Love is not always easy and gentle,” she said. “Love is action.”

Her family’s care became her first lesson in survival and compassion. It taught her that strength was not just physical endurance but rooted in the people who refused to give up on her.

By her teenage years, Phuc’s body had mostly healed, but her mind was still at war. She avoided mirrors, and long sleeves became her armor.

“When I looked at my arms — one smooth and beautiful, the other scarred and tight — I wondered, ‘How can I ever get married? How can I be a mother?’”

She turned her attention to education. Inspired by the doctors who had saved her, Phuc dreamed of becoming a physician herself. She threw herself into her studies and, in 1982, was accepted into medical school in Saigon. It was the fulfillment of everything she had fought for.

That hope, however, was short-lived. The Vietnamese government, realizing that the girl in the world-famous photograph was still alive, decided to use her as a symbol of state propaganda. Just as the war had torn apart her childhood, politics now threatened to shape her future.

“They pulled me from classes for endless interviews with the foreign press,” she said. “Once again, I became a victim — not of a bomb but of politics.”

The constant attention, the photo ops, the orchestrated media sessions, made her feel trapped again. But once again, Phuc found a way to endure.

“I begged the prime minister to let me study somewhere quiet,” she said. Eventually, her request was granted, and in 1986 she was sent to Cuba.

Cuba was meant to be an escape, but it came with its own challenges, according to Phuc.

“New country, new problems — they spoke Spanish!” she said, laughing. Once again, Phuc had to start over. She learned a new language, adapted to a new culture and tried to rebuild her life. But health complications from her burns forced her to abandon her medical studies.

The loss was devastating.

“My dream was crushed,” she said. “But I had to accept it. Sometimes new dreams have to pile up, and that’s okay.”

So, Phuc began to study Spanish and English, and discovered that education itself was her lifeline.

“What matters is having a growth mindset and a love of learning,” Phuc said. “A degree is just a foundation; your lifetime of learning is the true masterpiece.”

In Cuba, she also met the man who would become her husband, a fellow Vietnamese student named Bui Huy Toan. They married in 1992, hoping their honeymoon would be the beginning of a new chapter. Yet even on their honeymoon, the couple was followed by government minders.

“Even then, we were not free,” she said.

Their chance at freedom came by surprise. On their flight back to Havana, the plane stopped to refuel in Newfoundland, Canada. Kim turned to her husband and whispered, “We cannot go back. You must trust me.”

That moment changed their lives. They defected, stepping off the plane with nothing but their passports and her purse.

“That was true love,” Kim said, smiling at the memory. “He says I kidnapped him, but we defected.”

Canada became their refuge and their home. For the first time in decades, Kim could live without surveillance or fear. She began to rebuild her life once more, this time in peace.

But even as she settled into her new life, the image from 1972 continued to follow her. It appeared in textbooks, documentaries and exhibitions. The photo later became a symbol of war and suffering. For years, she wrestled with the burden of being “the napalm girl.”

Eventually, she decided that if the photograph would always follow her, it would do so with purpose. She began to speak publicly about her experiences, transforming her pain into advocacy.

Phuc founded the Kim Foundation International, a nonprofit dedicated to helping child victims of war and poverty. The foundation has built schools, hospitals, libraries and homes in Vietnam, Uganda, Ghana and other countries. It has also supported refugees fleeing conflicts in Ukraine and elsewhere.

“We cannot change the past,” she said, “but with love, we can heal the future.”

Forgiveness would become the most transformative lesson of her life. For years, she carried anger toward those who had dropped the bomb that scarred her. The hatred, she said, was its own kind of prison.

“Forgiveness is not a feeling; it’s a process,” she said. “When you forgive, you are not letting the other person off the hook — you are taking yourself off their hook.”

That belief was tested in 1996, when she was invited to speak at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. There she met Reverend John Plummer, a former Air Force officer involved in coordinating the airstrike that had burned her village.

“When we met face to face, we both cried,” Phuc recalled. “I told him from my heart: ‘I forgive you.’”

In that moment, a decades-long burden lifted. The two became friends (and remain so), united by a shared desire to turn pain into peace.

Today, Phuc is a Canadian citizen and a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador for the Culture of Peace. She travels the world speaking about reconciliation, resilience and the human capacity for compassion.

At Arizona State University, Phuc stood before dozens of students, many too young to remember the Vietnam War. However, she shared the lessons of a lifetime. Her story, once defined by fire, had evolved into one of purpose and hope.

“My challenge to you is to cultivate strength of heart and spirit,” Phuc said. “Be a beacon of perseverance, not just for yourself but for those around you.”

She offered the students three challenges to carry forward: be future focused in their decision making; seek to connect across boundaries; and choose to actively bring hope into the world.

“Hope is not passive; it’s a decision,” Phuc said. “Radical hope is grounded in courage, compassion and resilience.”

When the applause filled the auditorium, Kim stood quietly for a moment, hands clasped before her. Behind her, a projection of the iconic 1972 photograph appeared. The very image that had once captured her running and screaming.

She turned toward it and smiled.

“Now,” she said, “when you look at that image, don’t see a child running in fear and pain. See her as she is today — a survivor, a wife, a mother and a grandmother — someone who turned her pain into purpose and moved from scars to strength.”

She concluded: “In a world full of hate, anger and chaos, let us choose peace.”

When buying property in Arizona, water is often an important part of the decision, particularly in rural areas. The way real estate agents address questions like how secure the water supply is can influence a buyer’s confidence in their purchase.

As Arizona continues to navigate long-term water challenges, ensuring that agents are informed and equipped to communicate accurately about water is critical for their clients and communities.

That’s the motivation behind REAL Water Arizona — Improving Water Education for Real Estate Professionals, a new project led by Danielle Storey, user experience researcher with the Arizona Water Innovation Initiative, and Harry Cooper, the initiative’s director of water conservation innovation.

In partnership with the Arizona Department of Real Estate and supported by Impact Water — Arizona, the program is reimagining how water education is taught in the state’s mandatory continuing education course for licensed real estate professionals.

“We want to know how Arizona real estate agents are understanding the water topics being taught to them and how they apply this knowledge to advising clients,” Storey says. “Our project is focused on empowering instructors by focusing on their need for quality, reputable resources about Arizona water.”

Every two years, Arizona’s real estate agents must complete mandatory continuing education credits to renew their licenses, a process that includes one hour on water as part of a “Firewise, Deed Fraud and Water” course requirement that went into effect in 2024. Storey’s team has been closely reviewing how that mandate is playing out statewide.

“We’re assessing the quality of the instruction in the water portion of the course,” Storey says. “We are also assessing whether it’s realistic to cover the relevant water topics in one hour.”

So far, the team has observed 20 continuing education courses, evaluating how much and how well the Arizona Department of Real Estate’s official curriculum is being addressed. They are finding that while some instructors deliver engaging, in-depth lessons, many courses are, for example, limited to statewide information that could be more beneficial if locally tailored.

Beyond content quality, the project also examines what agents and their clients most want to know — from water rights and long-term availability to costs and quality — and how those concerns appear in real-world transactions and disclosure forms.

To get a full picture, Storey’s team has paired course observations with surveys and interviews, as well as targeted workshops designed to spark candid conversation. Over the past year, they’ve completed over 20 interviews and hosted nine workshops across six counties.

“We didn’t want the workshops to feel like lectures,” Storey says. “We wanted to go above and beyond what happens in the mandatory one-hour course and talk with agents about how water comes up in transactions and what kind of additional education would help them.”

These voluntary workshops attracted agents who were genuinely interested in water. Participants shared how clients often ask about groundwater reliability, wells or water quality — and how unprepared the agents sometimes feel to answer those questions confidently.

Storey notes the discussions revealed regional differences, with urban agents focused on regulated Active Management Areas and rural agents grappling with more uncertainty in unregulated zones. Together, those insights are helping the REAL Water team and the Arizona Department of Real Estate identify where educational support is most needed.

The initial results have shown that instructors and agents alike tend to shy away from crucial but complex subjects such as stream adjudications and the state’s Assured and Adequate Water Supply program.

“Agents don’t usually speak in terms like ‘assured water,’” Storey says. “They might say ‘a hundred years of water,’ but they don’t necessarily understand the legal or programmatic context behind that.”

These findings suggest that the state’s one-hour course can only go so far. That’s why REAL Water will pair the Arizona Department of Real Estate's water curriculum with a new digital learning portal offering at least two hours of water-focused curricula that meets the needs of real estate professionals in both the residential and commercial sectors.

The platform will allow instructors to tailor content by region — for instance, by focusing on local water supply maps or regulations specific to places like Prescott, Tucson or the Verde Valley — and incorporate up-to-date online tools from the Arizona Department of Water Resources and the Arizona Water Blueprint from the Kyl Center for Water Policy at ASU.

Storey emphasizes that REAL Water’s purpose extends beyond checking a box for license renewal. It’s about helping agents feel capable of explaining water issues with confidence and understanding their role in the state’s water future.

For example, although the Arizona Department of Real Estate’s outline doesn’t currently require it, Storey and Cooper view conservation education as essential.

“We know that understanding conservation at both the household and management-area levels can ease people’s worries about availability,” Cooper says. “If agents can connect those dots, they can help clients see that water security is something everyone contributes to.”

Real estate agents are often one of the first professions in contact with new, prospective residents or businesses.

“What they say, or don’t say, can make a huge difference to our regional economy and sustaining our culture of conservation,” Cooper added.

In addition, when agents understand how Active Management Areas are designed to safeguard long-term supply, Storey says, “they gain the ability to speak more confidently with out-of-state buyers and investors who may assume Arizona’s water situation is dire when in fact, strong management plans are in place in AMAs.”

Storey’s interest in the issue is both professional and personal.

“I’m from Arizona, and water is always top of mind. But I first got really interested in water resources when I spent a few years as a real estate agent in Austin, Texas, after college,” she says. 

After returning to Arizona and joining the Arizona Water Innovation Initiative, she recognized that real estate professionals are a key audience for outreach.

“I sat through a pretty poorly taught water course when I renewed my own license, and the more I talked with colleagues here at ASU I realized that real estate agents were a big community that we were hoping to reach,” Storey says. “That’s when I knew there was an opportunity to make this educational experience more meaningful for licensees.”

The project also explores how water awareness differs across the industry. Commercial brokers, Storey explains, often operate at a strategic business-to-business level — analyzing long-term supply and risk maps to advise clients. Residential agents, particularly in rural areas, engage in more personal, property-specific conversations where water quality and availability can be more immediate concerns.

The REAL Water team will present its quality assessment report to the Arizona Department of Real Estate this fall, followed by a public webinar for instructors. From there, the team will focus on building out the new digital learning portal addressing additional water topics in more depth than the mandatory course.

“We’re taking all the water expertise we have at ASU,” Storey says, “and helping them understand how agents feel about the existing water content in their course, as well as how to meet the needs of a community of agents that are eager to learn more.”

The Arizona Department of Real Estate has been an enthusiastic partner.

“Arizona has a special relationship with water, and just like sunshine and saguaros, it plays a big role in what makes a property tick — and what it’s worth,” says Mandy Neat, deputy commissioner at the department. “Understanding the basics helps everyone involved. We are excited to be collaborating with ASU to ensure quality education to all real estate licensees.”

Hojun Song has dedicated over two decades to studying locusts, grasshoppers, crickets and katydids — those jumping insects that most people would struggle to tell apart. But as the new director of the ASU Biocollections, Song is ready to step away from his comfort zone. 

“I thought I would spend all my life studying grasshoppers,” Song says, laughing. “But I’m actually excited that I can expand and work on other things.”

It won’t be hard to find new research interests at the Biocollections, which house nearly 4 million specimens and counting, one of the fastest-growing natural history collections in the country. 

The building, south of Tempe campus, is filled with creatures of all shapes and sizes: weevils the size of a fingernail, flat neon-green patches of lichen, even a taxidermied moose. 

Having access to such a massive variety of preserved specimens gives ASU scientists myriad research opportunities and gives students the chance to get hands-on experience learning about creatures from every corner of the world.

“This is a really valuable resource,” Song says, “not only for conserving biodiversity, but it could be a really good place to train the next generation of scientists.”

And he has ambitious plans to expand the collections and establish them as an integral part of biological research in the U.S.

“This amazing place just has a lot of potential,” Song says. “It can grow to be a really important and nationally recognized resource.”

Song moved from South Korea to the U.S. when he was 17 years old to follow his passion.

“I’ve always been fascinated with insects. I have a picture of myself, actually, holding a net with my little brother, collecting when I was a 5-year-old,” he says. “I guess I never grew out of it.”

He started out studying beetles at Cornell but got hooked on grasshoppers when he came across a picture of a swarm of locusts, which can gather in the millions, decimating subsistence farming in North Africa to the point of causing economic turmoil and famine. 

Song was stunned by the sheer abundance of the insects: “I had never seen anything like it.”

He switched to studying grasshopper evolution as a graduate student at Ohio State University. Then, as a postdoctoral researcher at Brigham Young University, he had his first international field research experience collecting grasshoppers and katydids in the hot and humid rainforests of Papua New Guinea.

The experience was transformative for Song. 

“Everything I touched was something I’d never seen before,” he said. “After I came back from that trip, I was like, ‘How do I do this more often?’” 

Since then, Song has collected jumping insects all over the world — from Australia to Cameroon to Costa Rica. He even once rented helicopters to spend a week looking for new species of grasshoppers at the top of unclimbable 9,000-foot cliffs in South Africa.

In between those adventures, Song was also busy establishing himself as one of the premier grasshopper researchers in the world. When he was a graduate student, few university researchers studied grasshoppers, he says.

“So when I finally got my faculty position, I decided that I want to ... train the next generation of scientists who study grasshoppers and katydids and crickets. I’ve been running my lab for 15 years, and every single one of my students are now experts.”

The choice to direct the ASU Biocollections was personal for Song, who spent much of his academic career using biological collections for his research: “I feel at home in the collections.”

He was particularly drawn to ASU’s collections because they are home to the NEON Biorepository, which vouchers all the specimens collected by the National Ecological Observatory Network, or NEON, a national program supported by the National Science Foundation that has been cataloguing and monitoring the biodiversity and ecological changes of 81 field sites around the country to create long-term datasets. 

ASU receives multimillion grant from NSF to create a national biorepository

Those datasets will keep a record of current environmental conditions across the U.S. and allow researchers to see how those conditions change over time — an especially important mission amid climate change and rising rates of biodiversity loss.

ASU is poised to construct a new wing of the Biocollections building specifically to house NEON samples for the next 30 years. Song believes that ASU’s role in housing those samples and making them accessible will elevate its importance to ecologists, biodiversity scientists and conservationists around the country.

Song says he was also excited to come to ASU because of his prior connection with the university's Global Locust Initiative. 

In 2020, with the help of Arianne Cease, director of the Global Locust Initiative, Song earned a $12.5 million NSF grant to create a virtual research institute supporting interdisciplinary research around locusts, which are genetically unique as well as socially and politically important.

By joining forces with the initiative, Song hopes that ASU can become the best place to conduct locust research. Specifically, he aims to create a large locust laboratory in the main campus, adjacent to the Global Locust Initiative, which will allow scientists to conduct behavioral research with tens of thousands of locusts at a time — something they rarely have the space for.

Before tackling those larger projects, though, Song’s first goal as the new director is simple: making the Biocollections more visible to the larger ASU community and beyond.

“A lot of people still don’t know that we have this amazing resource at ASU,” Song says.

“We want people to come visit more — scientists, the public — and we want this place to be used more. We have the capacity to do amazing things, so we want to do them.”

When a person needs emergency services, the first person they speak with is rarely a firefighter, police officer or paramedic. It’s a 911 operator or call taker, broadly called public safety communications personnel.

It’s a tough job. Call centers are noisy, and in many localities, the calls just keep coming and coming. The person on the other end of the line may be reporting an injury accident, phoning in a disturbance on their street or detailing a physical or emotional trauma they’re experiencing. The call taker must make quick decisions to deploy the necessary services, all while remaining calm as the caller describes what may be one of the worst days of their life.

Public safety communications personnel and their role in the criminal legal system are the subject of a new study led by Joseph A. Schafer, professor in Arizona State University's School of Criminology and Criminal Justice; Beth Huebner, director of the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice and Watts Endowed Professor of Public Safety; and Lee Slocum, Curators’ Distinguished Professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice, University of Missouri, St. Louis. 

The study aims to evaluate how these employees make classifications in an often hectic environment with limited information, as well as better understand 911 operators’ feelings of preparedness, training needs and trauma exposure. The research was funded by the MacArthur Foundation's Safety and Justice Challenge.

Researchers found that call takers must balance professional discretion and protocols, and those protocols are shaped by the structure and complexity of jurisdictions and the technologies used to process calls. Their role is made more difficult by challenges such as trauma exposure, demanding schedules and understaffing. 

Despite those challenges, patrol officers interviewed as part of the study noted that the information provided by 911 operators and call takers critically shapes their decisions and behaviors when arriving on scene.

“Public safety communications personnel work in a fast-paced environment with limited, incomplete, inaccurate and shifting information, and they very quickly have to make interpretive and classification judgments,” Schafer said. “We were curious: Do they feel prepared? Do they feel like they have the necessary training and tools?”

Changes to policies and practices, as well as enhanced training, can improve community safety and add value to the public safety communications personnel profession, researchers found.

Based on the study’s findings, the researchers recommended categorizing 911 operators and call takers as first responders, developing mutual learning experiences between communications personnel and patrol officers, and increasing call takers' access to training, professional development and mental health services.

Huebner, one of the study’s principal investigators, said of all of the recommendations, recognizing public safety communications personnel as first responders was the most critical. These jobs require strong communication and negotiation skills, but the employees who fill them are considered clerical workers with entry-level wages, and they are not given the same training or mental health services as police, fire and emergency medical workers, she said.

“It's really important to broaden our understanding of first responders and their exposure to trauma because call takers are hurting. Oftentimes they have to talk people down during a difficult time or offer them care,” Huebner said. “This needs to be seen as more of a career so that people can stay in those jobs, receive training for professional growth and receive holistic support so that they aren't harmed by this work.”

She highlighted Arizona’s 2023 legislation that extends the Traumatic Event Counseling Program to public safety communications personnel as a policy moving in the right direction.

In exploring the role of 911 operators and call takers, the team used three complementary research methods to better triangulate how these employees make decisions and where system improvements might enhance their work. The project included analyzing computer-aided dispatch, or CAD, data, conducting systematic social observation, and interviewing call takers, managers and patrol officers in three localities: East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana; St. Louis County, Missouri; and Charleston County, South Carolina. The study took nearly two years to complete.

Systematic social observation involved listening in on nearly 850 calls in real time. Schafer said the observations provided more “nuance” than just reviewing CAD data, allowing researchers to hear the tone of the operator as well as the actual requests of the public.

“Listening to calls demonstrated, in a more tangible way, the complexity of the work and gave us a much deeper understanding of the nuance, uncertainty and ambiguity that public safety communications personnel have to operate under,” Schafer said. “It also showed us that there are a lot of opportunities to better assess the decisions that these employees make and to develop better protocols and evidence-based training to help them go from good to great in their work.”

Shifts in recognizing the training needs and trauma exposure of public safety communications personnel are happening, and more can be done for career development, added Schafer. For him, doing the research reinforced the concern that public safety communications personnel are frequently overlooked within the justice system, by the public and by researchers.

“The research community hasn't comprehensively explored how these employees go about their business,” Schafer said. 

The report’s final recommendation is to continue research into call takers’ discretion and its effect on patrol officers.

Wayne Johnson’s story is one of persistence across decades.

A Vietnam veteran and a father, he had always dreamed of teaching at the college level. That dream, however, kept being delayed by the realities of life: raising a family, building a career and simply surviving the ups and downs that came his way.

Finally, more than 50 years after earning a bachelor’s degree from Florida State University, the next step toward his dream was realized when he walked across the stage again — this time with a master’s degree in international affairs and leadership from Arizona State University’s School of Politics and Global Studies through ASU Online.

The moment wasn’t just about a diploma. It was about closing a circle that had remained open for half a century.

His journey back to the classroom wasn’t easy. Technology had completely transformed education, and Johnson found himself navigating online platforms, digital research and modern academic standards. But the challenge energized him. Professors and classmates alike admired his discipline and the perspective he brought to discussions, forged from years of lived experience rather than textbooks alone.

The media took notice, too. ASU News and various local news outlets spotlighted him not only as a graduate but as a symbol of lifelong learning — a reminder that it’s never too late to pursue unfinished goals.

Now, with degree in hand, Johnson looks toward the future with renewed purpose. He plans to step into the classroom again; this time, not as a student but as a guest lecturer at the high school and college level, sharing both knowledge and the resilience it took him a lifetime to earn.

Now, 50 years after the end of the Vietnam War and as part of ASU's annual Salute to Service celebration, Johnson spoke to ASU News from his home in Houston to share his thoughts on the war, his Army service and what it means to him today.

Question: What motivated you to serve in the Vietnam War?

Johnson: For some unknown reason, I flunked out of my first year of college, and my draft board offered me a job. I was offered an opportunity to attend Officer Candidate School at the induction center. A little over a year later, at only 20 years old, on Nov. 20, 1967, I was an infantry second lieutenant. The maturity gained in that year served me well for the rest of my life.

Q: What was your first impression when you arrived in Vietnam?

A: I had already spent a month in the Philippine islands, as my dad was stationed at Clark Air Force Base, so I was accustomed to the climate. On the flight in, I remember I could smell Vietnam before we could see land. My first impression was a blur as I went through processing and was assigned to Bravo Company, 2nd Battalion (Mechanized), 47th Infantry Regiment, 9th Infantry Division, in the Mekong Delta. When I arrived at my unit, I met my company commander in a bunker guarding the Ben Luc bridge just south of Saigon. A hot, dirty, primitive area, I was unfamiliar with the armored personnel carrier M-113. I wondered what I would do the first time I made contact with the enemy. I was a platoon leader in a combat assignment who had never actually led a platoon! Unsure, scared and bewildered, I was somewhat comforted by the fact that I had been raised in the military and had a basic understanding of command.

Q: Can you share a memory — good or bad — that has stayed with you the most?

A: I’ll share two. The first is about the first time I was actually in contact with a Viet Cong unit. Without hesitation, I did my job. My training kicked in and I led my platoon.

The second is the last day I was in Vietnam. We had been in a running firefight all night. That morning, I saw the company commander's radio telephone operator reaching for what I believed to be a booby-trapped sign, and I tried to stop him. I was a second too slow. Kenny died, many others were wounded and I wound up in the hospital for three months and was transferred back to the States.

Q: How did your service impact your life once you returned home?

A: Several ways. First, at 22, I was far more mature than the civilian world was willing to accept. Every Vietnam veteran had far more life experience than the civilian world was prepared to acknowledge or accept. We were already old.

Second, for the next 30 years, I had to contend with how uncomfortable people were with the knowledge that I had been a combat platoon leader. I learned to leave off any mention of my service on resumes and not to talk about Vietnam.

Lastly, I had to deal with the effects of PTSD without knowing what it was or what to do about it. Perhaps the most telling experience happened in 2004 when I was receiving treatment at the VA, and the wives met. My wife told me as we were leaving that for the first time, she realized she was not alone. Other wives had been dealing with “us” for their whole marriages.

Q: What do you wish more people understood about Vietnam veterans and their experiences?

A: Even today, this applies to the entire civilian world concerning every veteran who has served in a combat zone — from Vietnam to the 20-year War on Terror. The military trains us to be soldiers; no matter the service, we are taught to be military. There is no training given on how to become a civilian again. None.

For most of the Vietnam veterans, they were in the field in combat three days before being sent back to the States. Two days before, they were in their base camp, turning in their equipment. One day before, they were on airplanes returning. The next day, they were home. In three days, they were to go from being a combat soldier with more responsibility than any civilian their age could imagine to being expected to be the boy on the block they were just two or three years ago — an impossible transition.

Q: What does military service mean to you?

A: I was raised in the military. Service was always understood in the terms of duty, honor, country. It was understood that there was a duty, a responsibility, to protect the Constitution of the United States — not a person, but the Constitution, from all enemies, both foreign and domestic. I believe that responsibility also extends to each and every citizen.

While on active duty, there is an obligation to follow all legal orders and to live by a standard of discipline that requires personal sacrifice. There is a code of conduct each soldier commits to that requires honor and integrity above that required by civilian life. We commit to being in a constant state of mental, physical and emotional readiness to protect the United States above all else in our lives.

 

When a person needs emergency services, the first person they speak with is rarely a firefighter, police officer or paramedic. It’s a 911 operator or call taker, broadly called public safety…

Rain Hashimoto walked a red carpet, attended a gala and took in the sights in the fashion mecca of New York this week — all because she believed in herself.

Hashimoto, a student at Arizona State University, was honored in New York on Nov. 4 for her recent selection as one of Glamour magazine’s 2025 College Women of the Year. One of six students chosen from around the country, she is majoring in fashion merchandising at ASU FIDM in Los Angeles.

“It is such a gratifying experience, especially as someone who struggles with imposter syndrome and being a perfectionist,” said Hashimoto, a junior who also is earning a degree in international relations through The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.

“It’s a motivator to keep on going as well as a sign from the universe that my hard work meant something. When I saw all the other ladies who were on the list, I felt a deep sense of gratitude to be among them.”

When she got the email that she was chosen, she was at first suspicious.

“I thought it was a scam,” she said.

“I was checking the email address and running it through scam checkers. Then I was like, ‘Oh, this is real.’”

Glamour magazine started the feature in 1957, when it published “The 10 Best-Dressed College Girls in America.” Over the years, the contest evolved to recognize women’s accomplishments, variously focusing on historically Black colleges and universities, athletes and community colleges. This year, the magazine said, it went “back to its roots” by choosing fashion students.

Glamour highlighted Hashimoto’s journey, in which she grew up in a small town in Oahu, Hawaii, and had fun styling her friends. She got an associate degree from FIDM in 2024 and returned to Hawaii, where she got a good job as a marketing coordinator for a jewelry company. But she wanted to push herself, and she realized that she could pursue a bachelor’s degree at ASU FIDM.

She told Glamour: “It was the biggest risk, leaving something that was stable and comforting for the unknown. But it was honestly so worth it. … I love being in school, so that’s something I don’t regret doing.”

Her career goal is to be a creative director or marketing director for a luxury brand, and she’s now a marketing intern at Mina Baie, which makes bags.

“I want to start my own nonprofit to help communities that are affected by harsh labor conditions and sweatshops in the fashion industry,” she said.

“I would like to work overseas as well, which is part of the reason I started studying international relations.”

Hashimoto said her favorite fashion designer is Iris van Herpen, who creates avant-garde, sculptural designs. For the Glamour gala, she was a bit more practical though, buying a dress from the House of CB, a British brand.

“It's very Audrey Hepburn-inspired and classy,” she said. “It’s a black dress you could wear multiple times.”

She also likes a vintage vibe.

“I love to go thrifting and I'm still trying to find good thrifting spots in LA since I moved back,” she said.

“A lot of my pieces are from my mom's closet and my family's closet. I feel like that's my store. I go in and I'm like, ‘I'm gonna take this, thank you.’

“Fashion is so circular. There are pieces where I'm like, ‘That's so ugly.’ And then a year later, I'm like, ‘I actually want that.’”

Hashimoto says she’s grown a lot from the 17-year-old who started classes in Los Angeles.

“My favorite thing to say is that anyone is capable of change,” she said.

“I was extremely overwhelmed, emotional and immature. I was not the best student and felt a lot of imposter syndrome.”

She struggled academically before catching up and finishing her associate degree with good grades and three internships.

“I want people to know that it’s OK to not be perfect and struggle, but to also know that you’re brave enough to make a change in your life,” she said.

“You just have to trust yourself. Don’t let other people's perceptions of you make you scared to grow and evolve.”

Arizona State University Executive Vice President and University Provost Nancy Gonzales experienced a unique perspective at Saturday’s football game — as conductor of “The Star-Spangled Banner” with the Sun Devil Marching Band.

“Every game day is special, but today was extra special because we had our provost Dr. Nancy Gonzales on the ladder, conducting the national anthem,” said Jason Caslor, associate professor and director of bands. “Adding a layer of pride, she was actually a member of this band when she attended ASU!”

An Arizona native and ASU alumna, Gonzales received her bachelor’s degree in psychology from ASU. While a student, she played trumpet in the Sun Devil Marching Band under the direction of Robert C. “Coach” Fleming.

After ASU, Gonzales attended the University of Washington for a master’s and doctorate degree, and then Stanford University as a clinical intern and postdoctoral fellow. As ASU’s chief academic officer, Gonzales oversees the university’s academic mission across its 19 interdisciplinary colleges and schools, positioning ASU as one of the largest and most innovative Research I institutions in the country.

“This is a perk of being the university provost that I never imagined!” Gonzales said. “I mentioned that I had played in the marching band, and I got invited to help lead them in the national anthem.”

More than 350 ASU students participate in the Sun Devil Marching Band, representing more than 100 different majors. 

“I’m really so proud of their dedication and the way they come together as a massive team representing a wide range of colleges and disciplines at ASU,” Gonzales said.

When Anthony Robles stepped back onto the Arizona State University West Valley campus this week, he wasn’t just returning to his alma mater — he was coming home.

The NCAA wrestling champion, motivational speaker and author of ""Unstoppable: From Underdog to Undefeated: How I Became a Champion"" inspired students, faculty, staff and community members during his visit for “Rise Like Robles,” an event dedicated to perseverance, purpose and the power of mindset.

Anthony Robles will give the Graduate College's Elizabeth A. Wentz Distinguished Lecture from 5–7 p.m. Wednesday, Oct. 29, at the Memorial Union on ASU's Tempe campus.

RSVP

Robles, who was born with one leg and went on to win the 2011 NCAA individual wrestling national championship at 125 pounds, shared his story of resilience and determination, a journey that began right here at ASU.

“It’s an honor to be back at ASU,” Robles said. “This is home, this is where my journey went through its ups and downs. I’m a proud Sun Devil, and I’m thrilled to share what being unstoppable truly means.”

Throughout the day, Robles engaged with the ASU community across campus — meeting scholars at the Herberger Young Scholars Academy, joining student leaders for a panel discussion, visiting with staff and faculty, and closing the evening with his empowering keynote in the La Sala Ballrooms.

His message remained constant: Stay focused on what you’re chasing, believe in yourself and lean on the people who support you.

“There are always setbacks and delays,” Robles said. “But with every challenge, there’s a chance to learn and grow stronger. You celebrate the progress, those small steps, and that’s what keeps you moving forward.”

At the evening event, introduced by Regina Matos, dean of students for ASU's West Valley campus, Robles reflected on how the ASU experience helped shape his approach to challenges both on and off the wrestling mat. 

He also signed copies of his book, took photos with attendees and spent time connecting one on one with students who called his story “life-changing.”

Robles’ mother, Judith Robles, associate director of student-athlete and family engagement for Sun Devil Athletics, joined her son for the event. She reflected on the experience of raising a champion, and how ASU supported her family’s journey.

“It’s humbling and inspiring to see who Anthony has become,” she said. “As parents, the best thing we can do is let our children know that we love them, believe in them and will be there no matter what.”

Judith, herself a proud Sun Devil and mother of four ASU graduates, credits the ASU community for helping her son succeed and for motivating her to earn her own degree.

“ASU gave Anthony a community of support,” she said. “The people who guided him through his challenges are the reason he found his path. That same support inspired me to go back to school and graduate too.”

No limits to a mother’s love, a wrestler’s determination

Education a family affair for Robles clan

Robles, who is currently an ESPN analyst, continues to share his story across the nation, encouraging audiences to see obstacles as opportunities and to define success through mindset rather than circumstance.

His story is also the subject of the feature film ""Unstoppable,"" released earlier this year.

“It doesn’t matter what you’re wrestling,” Robles told the audience. “What matters is your mentality. You can list reasons why you can’t do something or you can focus on why you can. That’s what being unstoppable is all about.”

As students and community members left the event, many said they felt renewed motivation to face their own challenges with courage.

“Today’s speech was very motivating,” said Julian, a TRIO scholar in the Tolleson Union High School District. “Anthony inspired me to never give up.”

Through his words, his journey and his Sun Devil pride, Robles reminded the ASU community that being unstoppable isn’t about perfection, it’s about persistence. And sometimes, the best way to rise is to rise together.

A planned multiyear renovation of Desert Financial Arena on the Tempe campus will incorporate new seating, including 729 new padded ones with cupholders, 200 “premium” seats that are wider and have 2 inches more leg room, and four “Hollywood” seats, which provide excellent courtside views.

Desert Financial Arena is about to get a brand-new look.

Arizona State University is embarking on a multiyear, multiphase renovation of the arena — home of the Sun Devils’ men’s and women’s basketball, volleyball, gymnastics and wrestling teams — with an estimated cost of $100 million.

The project, which has an anticipated completion date of December 2029 and requires approval by the Arizona Board of Regents, includes:

The project also includes locker room improvements and upgrades to the air conditioning system, as well as ensuring ADA compliance with new elevators and accessible stairs, with handrails, to the event floor.

“We’re building a game day experience that matches the passion and pride of our fans while giving our Sun Devil teams a true home court advantage,” said Graham Rossini, ASU athletics director. “The renovation of Desert Financial Arena is about more than updating a building — it’s about creating a space that energizes our entire ASU community.”

The majority of the work will take place during the months of April to October, ensuring the teams that use the arena will not have to play their games elsewhere, Rossini said.

ASU President Michael Crow said renovations of the 51-year-old building will take both fan and student-athlete experiences into a new era.

“For half a century, this arena has welcomed students, fans, families and community members for memorable events and cherished celebrations,” Crow said. “As a beloved gateway to the Sun Devil experience, we are excited that these renovations will provide a superb, modern arena for the next 50 years and many more special connections for our extended ASU community.”

Construction will begin in May 2026. In Phase 1, the court will be replaced and 729 seats in the lower bowl will be swapped for padded seats that include cupholders. In addition, 200 “premium” seats that are wider and have 2 inches more leg room will be installed, and four “Hollywood” seats, which provide excellent courtside views, will be built between the ASU bench and the scorer’s table.

Phase 2 of the project, set for summer 2027, will include the renovation of existing restrooms, the construction of two new men’s and women’s bathrooms, and a new sound system, said Joe Lisiewski, ASU’s assistant vice president and university architect.

Multiple loge boxes are planned for the concourse above the lower bowl. The boxes, which will seat a total of 120 people, are planned to include amenities like television screens and small tables for food and drinks. “Theater boxes” — featuring wider, padded seats that include cupholders — will be built on the bottom of the upper bowl.

The changes will reduce the current official capacity of 14,198, but Lisiewski said a new capacity will not be determined until ASU hires a design-build firm, plans are drawn up and construction is underway.

The concourses at the arena also will get a makeover with showcases of great sporting and cultural moments that have taken place in the building, such as the first performance of “Hotel California” by the Eagles in 1976 and multiple NCAA Tournaments that were held there.

Phase 3 of the renovation, scheduled for summer 2027, includes a basketball court-level club that will be accessible to premium ticket holders. The club will have direct access to courtside seating.

Upgraded concession stand offerings also are in the plans for Phase 3. Lisiewski said offices in Desert Financial Arena will be relocated to open space up for venues like self-serve food kiosks.

This phase will also include upgraded locker rooms and a new video board to be hung over center court, and ribbon boards — long, narrow LED displays that can display ad content, game stats or fan messages — are planned for each side of the arena.

The Sun Devil Athletics website will include information on reseating for season ticket holders and members of the Sun Devil Club who are interested in the new seating sections.

Fundraising will be key to the project, which is part of ASU’s Changing Futures Campaign, and those interested in learning more can contact Scott Nelson, senior associate athletics director and executive director of the Sun Devil Club, at [email protected].

“Through the Changing Futures campaign, we’re inviting Sun Devils everywhere to join us in shaping the future of this campus landmark,” Rossini said.

This investment is part of ASU’s Changing Futures campaign. Fueled by philanthropic investment and unique partnerships, the campaign focuses on six key areas: enhancing education access, developing leaders, promoting sustainability, strengthening communities, advancing health and developing impactful technology.

This fall, four Arizona State University faculty members have added a new title to their list of merits: President’s Professor.

The designation, one of the most prestigious faculty honors, is given to honor and reward inspiration and innovation in the classroom, as well as research and scholarly contributions.

The 2025 awardees are: K. Selçuk Candan and Sarah Stabenfeldt in the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering, and Steve Semken and Cindi SturtzSreetharan in The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.

Learn more about these professors and their accomplishments:

Canden, a professor of computer science and engineering in the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence, is internationally recognized for his pioneering work in managing and analyzing large, complex and often imprecise datasets — ranging from multimedia and web content to scientific research data and medical records.

Over his nearly three decades at ASU, he has authored more than 250 peer-reviewed articles, holds 10 patents and has secured more than $34 million in research funding to advance data-driven decision-making. His projects have spanned critical areas such as pandemic preparedness, sustainability, water resilience, energy optimization and medical technologies.

Candan has mentored dozens of doctoral, graduate and undergraduate students, often extending his support to high school researchers. His teaching is celebrated for blending technical depth with real-world relevance, sparking curiosity and creativity in students who go on to become leaders in academia, industry and public service.

“Being a teacher and mentor is the most rewarding part of my career,” Candan says. “I want my students to see that the concepts we study are not just abstract theories but tools that can be used to solve real problems and make a difference in people’s lives. This recognition is truly an honor because it reflects the success and growth of the students I’ve had the privilege to work with.”

Ross Maciejewski, director of the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence, says the recognition is well deserved.

“Selçuk’s career is a masterclass in how to integrate scholarly excellence with a deep commitment to student success,” Maciejewski says. “He’s not only advanced the field of data science in areas like public health, sustainability and artificial intelligence, but he’s also inspired generations of students through his enthusiasm, mentorship and innovation in teaching. His impact on ASU and beyond will be felt for decades.”

Stabenfeldt is a distinguished professor at the School of Biological and Health Systems Engineering and serves on numerous scientific journal editorial boards and review panels.

Since joining the ASU community in 2011, Stabenfeldt has dedicated her career to researching regenerative medicine strategies for acute neural injury. Her efforts have been honored with an array of accolades, including the 2015 Arizona Biomedical Research Consortium Early-Stage Investigator Award, the National Institutes of Health Director’s New Innovator Award and the 2015 National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) Award. She recently received the Mosaic Award for her dedication to the biomedical engineering community.

“From day one, it was clear to me that ASU provides opportunities to innovate in all aspects of a faculty’s role,” Stabenfeldt says. “This mindset, along with commitment to advancing education for all to succeed, keeps me motivated to contribute to ASU’s vision/mission for years to come.”

Stabenfeldt is co-leading a regenerative medicine graduate training program that fosters transdisciplinary skills and connects students with the booming local biotech industry.

“Sarah is an amazing asset to ASU, and our students benefit every day from her time here,” says Heather Clark, director of the School of Biological and Health Systems Engineering. “Whether it’s in the classroom or lab, she touches a lot of lives.”

Semken is a professor of geology and education in the School of Earth and Space Exploration. His work spans geological heritage, virtual field education and the geological evolution of southwestern North America.

He is a Geological Society of America Fellow and has served as past-president and a distinguished speaker of the National Association of Geoscience Teachers. His scholarship actively informs his teaching, where he engages students through culturally responsive, place-based methods that spark curiosity and encourage active learning.

Semken is also a co-creator of the award-winning Trail of Time interpretive trail at Grand Canyon National Park. Beyond the university, he shares his passion for geology with the public through the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at ASU and at Yavapai College in Arizona’s Verde Valley, and by leading geologic hikes at many state and national parks.

""I am humbled by and truly grateful for this recognition, as the scholarship and effective practice of geoscience teaching have always been of greatest professional importance to me,” Semken said. “I deeply appreciate the enthusiasm of my students and the support of my colleagues at ASU and count myself very fortunate to be able to live, work and teach in beautiful Arizona.""

“This is a very well-deserved honor for Professor Semken. He is a serious and dedicated teacher focused on Earth science literacy,” said Ramon Arrowsmith, interim director for the School of Earth and Space Exploration. “He is deeply committed to his students and colleagues and to understanding Earth science and how it is learned and relevant locally. The School of Earth and Space Exploration is very proud and honored to have him as our colleague.”

SturtzSreetharan is a highly regarded linguistic anthropologist and professor in the School of Human Evolution and Social Change.

She has been at the forefront of linguistic anthropology, studying how language reflects and influences society. She emphasizes language, not only as communication, but as a form of social action capable of fostering empathy, inclusion and meaningful change.

Her commitment to teaching extends beyond her classroom. She is the lead author of “Fat in Four Cultures: A Global Ethnography of Weight,” a textbook specifically written to engage undergraduates and to teach empathy around weight. She also co-authored the textbook “The Human Story: An Introduction to Anthropology,” integrating linguistic anthropology across all chapters of the introductory textbook.
