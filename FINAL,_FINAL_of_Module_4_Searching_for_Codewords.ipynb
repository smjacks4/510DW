These pressures, when not managed, can ripple into family life, affecting both parents\\u2019 and children\\u2019s emotional well-being.\\n\\nIn response to challenges like these, the Reach Institute at Arizona State University developed ADAPT for First Responders, a new online parenting program that offers research-based guidance to help first responders and other frontline professionals manage the demands of family life and support healthy relationships at home.\\n\\n\\u201cMany families in these professions experience stressors that traditional parenting programs weren\\u2019t built to address,\\u201d said Abigail Gewirtz, professor of psychology and director of the Reach Institute. \\u201cADAPT for First Responders gives parents practical, flexible tools that fit their unique circumstances.\\u201d\\n\\nOriginally developed for military families, ADAPT (Adaptive Parenting Tools) has been redesigned for first responder families\\u00a0with knowledge gained from local partners, including Mesa Fire and Medical Department, Gilbert Police Department and Phoenix Police Department. These partners have highlighted key considerations such as first responder challenges and pain points, barriers to resource utilization and qualities of successful programming.\\n\\n\\u201cPrograms like ADAPT are essential for first responders because they recognize the unique stressors we face \\u2014 not just on the job, but at home,\\u201d said Sgt. Mark Worden, who oversees peer support and wellness for the Gilbert Police Department. \\u201cI\\u2019ve seen firsthand how resources like ADAPT can strengthen families, improve communication and support the overall wellness of our officers. For parents, these programs offer tools to better connect with their children, manage the emotional toll of the job and model resilience in the face of adversity.\\u201d\\n\\nFor a limited time, the course is available at no cost for first responders anywhere in the U.S.\\n\\nLearn how to access the course.\\n\\nThe program is fully online, offering interactive lessons, practical tools and guided exercises that parents can complete on their own schedule. Parents and caregivers learn skills to strengthen communication, manage transitions and build a calm and connected home life.\\n\\n\\u201cThis isn\\u2019t about adding one more thing to already overburdened parents,\\u201d Gewirtz said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s about empowering parents to thrive and help them become their children\\u2019s best teachers and role models.\\u201d\\n\\nBy launching ADAPT for First Responders, ASU is embedding its use-inspired research directly into the community and helping families reduce stress, improve family relationships and support overall well-being.\\n\\n\\u201cWhen people are in moments of desperation, simply knowing that a resource exists can help calm the emotional storm,\\u201d Worden said. \\u201cIt creates space for hope, for clarity and for connection. The partnership between Gilbert PD and ASU Reach Institute reflects our shared commitment to proactive, research-backed support for those who serve.\\u201d\\n\\nThe program is now open to first responder and frontline families, with free access available for a limited time. Early participants report that the strategies are immediately useful and that their children are noticing the difference, too.\\n\\n\\u201cThis work is about resilience at every level,\\u201d Gewirtz said. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve seen how the stress of high-demand jobs can spill over into family life. When first responder families have support at home, parents are able to manage those pressures and be there fully for their children \\u2014 and that, in turn, strengthens their ability to serve the community.

Photo by Charlie Leight/ASU News\\n\\nThey may have just stepped out of their teens, but they\\u2019re already stepping up to change the world.\\u00a0\\n\\nThe latest \\\"AZ Inno Under 25\\u201d list, published by the Phoenix Business Journal, includes four rising stars from Arizona State University: students Camille S. Campbell, Sandul Gangodagamage and Kentarou Siejak, and alumnus Will Xander.\\u00a0\\n\\nThe annual list honors entrepreneurs under 25 who are daring to disrupt industries and redefine what\\u2019s possible through bold, creative ventures.\\n\\nBetween them, they\\u2019ve written books, launched startups and nonprofits, produced films, delivered TEDx Talks, and collected an impressive lineup of awards and prize money.\\u00a0\\n\\nThese young innovators are not just shaping Arizona\\u2019s future but making waves on a global scale.\\n\\nAt just 21, Camille S. Campbell already has a r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9 that reads like the life\\u2019s work of someone twice her age. A published author by 14 and founder of a nonprofit by 20, the third-year student is proving that creativity and technology can thrive together.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019ve always been passionate about storytelling and the transformative effect stories can have on people,\\u201d Campbell said. \\u201cThey can better lives, inspire change and empower others to tell their own stories.\\u201d\\n\\nASU honors student authors book celebrating beauty, culture of Ukraine\\n\\nThat mission started early. Growing up in New Mexico and later Scottsdale, Arizona, she was homeschooled before studying at ASU, where she\\u2019s now a double major in finance and digital marketing at the\\u00a0W. P. Carey School of Business and a\\u00a0Barrett, The Honors College student.\\n\\n\\u201cI think being homeschooled made me a self-starter,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt taught me how to balance a lot at once.\\u201d\\n\\nHer first nonprofit,\\u00a0Rising Poets Community, launched when she was just 17. Since then, it\\u2019s distributed thousands of free books to children worldwide, including those in Ukraine through her art therapy initiative \\u201cColors of Ukraine.\\u201d The picture book, which she both authored and funded through the ASU\\u2019s Venture Devils 2024 social impact pitch competition and private philanthropists, was given free to children in war zones.\\n\\n\\u201cI wanted to give them something that brings hope \\u2014 a book that could be theirs, even in the middle of chaos,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nBut Campbell\\u2019s vision extends far beyond storytelling. Her latest venture, the\\u00a0AI Innovators Foundation, bridges creativity and technology by teaching kids about artificial intelligence through storytelling and hands-on projects.\\n\\n\\u201cI want to show students that AI isn\\u2019t something to fear,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a tool for creativity and a co-creator that helps us imagine and build new things.\\u201d\\n\\nCampbell is also a co-director of\\u00a0AI Salon Arizona, a global organization fostering discussion around the intersection of technology and humanity. This week, she\\u2019s moderating a panel at ASU\\u2019s AI conference, which she considers another milestone on a list that keeps growing.\\n\\nWhen asked how she manages her workload \\u2014 seven published books, two majors, two nonprofits, and leadership in AI circles \\u2014 Campbell laughed.\\n\\n\\u201cSometimes it\\u2019s a lot, but I genuinely love it,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThe passion drives me.\\u201d\\n\\nAs she looks ahead to graduation in 2027, Campbell is already developing a storytelling technology platform that she hopes will empower everyone to be a creator.\\n\\n\\u201cCanva made design accessible to everyone,\\u201d she says. \\u201cI want to do that for storytelling and help people become the main character of their own lives.\\u201d\\n\\nWhen Sandul Gangodagamage talks about building a gaming company in college, his excitement is threaded with a strong passion to build great products for millions across the world.\\n\\nBorn in Minnesota and now residing in Arizona, the 20-year-old is a third-year student at the W. P. Carey School of Business studying business and computer science. He launched\\u00a0Legion Platforms from a problem he knew firsthand: bad internet, weak computers and games that took up hundreds of gigabytes.\\n\\n\\u201cI just couldn't access games at all,\\u201d Gangodagamage said. \\u201cIt would take 15, 20 minutes to load \\u2026 the games were so laggy. It was basically unplayable.\\u201d\\n\\nWhat began as a pirate game in high school has become a platform company. Gangodagamage said the first title reached 500,000 players while he was a senior in 2023; today, Legion Platforms claims 13 million users and aims for 20 million within a year.\\n\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019re the largest gaming company in Arizona, but we\\u2019re just getting started,\\u201d said Gangodagamage, whose entrepreneurial drive has already earned him top honors in several university pitch competitions. They include first place in\\u00a0ASU Venture Devils, Tech Devil\\u2019s Innovation and Lab-to-Launch. He also received recognition as a 2025 first-place regional winner in Princeton\\u2019s TigerLaunch, the world\\u2019s largest student-run entrepreneurship contest.\\n\\nBy building browser-based, cloud-optimized multiplayer games that load in seconds and run on low-end machines, Legion avoids downloads, storage bloat and lag. The result is a product designed for dorm-room MacBooks and handheld phones. This accessibility-first design philosophy means anyone from across the world can access a 3D multiplayer experience in seconds, bridging the gap between high-quality graphics and universal playability. Legion is also completely free to play, built on a mission to bring gaming to everyone.\\u00a0\\n\\nHe said he builds games for everyone so friends can invite friends, play together and spread the product by word of mouth. The games are built to spark interaction, whether through quick competitive matches, shared achievements or in-game events, Gangodagamage said.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u201cThe majority of our users that I\\u2019ve met in person have told me they found out about our games through a friend telling them,\\u201d Gangodagamage said. \\u201cWord of mouth is huge.\\u201d\\n\\nFor Gangodagamage, success isn\\u2019t measured in profit margins, but in the number of people whose lives his platform can touch. His vision is bold and unshakable: to make Legion a name known in households everywhere, sparking conversations and inspiring players for years to come.\\n\\n\\u201cThe goal is to literally change the world,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nEighteen-year-old Kentarou Siejak is redefining what it means to be a changemaker.\\u00a0A second-year W. P. Carey School of Business student, he\\u2019s already an entrepreneur, public speaker, author and film producer with a vision far beyond his years.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019ve lived all over the world as a military kid,\\u201d said Siejak, who routinely delivers\\u00a0TEDx Talks\\u00a0and keynote speeches to college students and organizations. \\u201cI\\u2019ve seen how awful the world can be and how amazing it can be. If each person strives to do more in support of others, we\\u2019d all be in a much better place.\\u201d\\n\\nThat belief in leading by example drives everything Siejak does. From tech startups to community mentorship, he\\u2019s proving that innovation can also have heart. His current projects \\u2014 most in the AI and robotics space \\u2014 are designed to make technology more human-centered. One team he helped build is developing a phone case that uses microfluid technology to help people who are blind read from their screens.\\n\\n\\u201cThat one excites me the most,\\u201d he said with a grin. \\u201cIt\\u2019s about creating something useful that really changes lives.\\u201d\\n\\nSiejak\\u2019s passion for impact also extends to film. He\\u2019s producing a feature-length movie on mental health awareness, which was shot entirely on an iPhone and produced at ASU\\u2019s\\u00a0Piper Writers House.\\n\\n\\u201cI want to show people you don\\u2019t need a big budget to make something meaningful,\\u201d he said. \\u201cMental health isn\\u2019t just a struggle \\u2014 it\\u2019s proof that you can rise above what tries to hold you back.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite his remarkable list of achievements, Siejak is disarmingly humble.\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t think I\\u2019m a prodigy,\\u201d said Siejak, who also offers leadership coaching to organizations. \\u201cI just hate seeing potential wasted. So many young people have ideas but stop because they\\u2019re told they can\\u2019t. I want to be living proof that you can.\\u201d\\n\\nHe\\u2019s already written two books \\u2014 \\u201cTeen Success: From Nothing to Something\\u201d and \\u201cTeen Failure: From Nothing to Nothing\\u201d \\u2014 a candid reflection on the highs and lows of ambition. A third book on leadership is on the way.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s about the lessons I\\u2019ve learned leading teams since I was 6 years old,\\u201d he says. \\u201cLeadership is everything. It\\u2019s what makes or breaks a business, a community, even a society.\\u201d\\n\\nWill Xander already carries the confidence and composure of a seasoned entrepreneur. The 23-year-old is the founder and CEO of Truthkeep, an AI-driven data analytics company serving Fortune 500 semiconductor clients.\\u00a0\\n\\nBefore he graduated from Arizona State University in 2024 with a degree in organizational leadership and project management, Xander had already closed over $60 million in real estate deals as a multifamily broker for Scottsdale-based ORION Investment Real Estate.\\n\\n\\u201cI always knew that my steppingstone into the business world would be through being a commercial real estate broker,\\u201d Xander said. \\u201cIf you worked really hard and understood the business, you could make good money. It was one of those moments where hard work and preparation met good luck.\\u201d\\n\\nThat success gave him the freedom to pursue his deeper passion for technology and innovation.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019ve always been curious about how things progress \\u2014 technology, the economy, inventions, the way society evolves,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAfter my success in real estate, I knew I needed to start an AI company.\\u201d\\n\\nFounded in 2023, Truthkeep helps large semiconductor firms manage and interpret enormous amounts of data, from product specs to customer insights. The company\\u2019s AI systems analyze tens of thousands of data points each month to identify trends and inefficiencies.\\n\\n\\u201cOur platform helps teams develop smarter roadmaps,\\u201d Xander said. \\u201cIf a customer is struggling with a certain product, our system highlights that and directs it to the right team to fix.\\u201d\\n\\nRunning a company, he says, isn\\u2019t much different from selling.\\n\\n\\u201cBeing a CEO is really just being a salesperson,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou\\u2019re creating relationships, fostering trust and providing real value.\\u201d\\n\\nXander\\u2019s team of 13 operates largely remotely, though the company is based in Tempe.\\n\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019re a lean, productive team,\\u201d he said, adding that his focus is not on size but on solving big problems. \\u201cWe want to create massive impact. Semiconductor is one of the most important industries in the world, and that\\u2019s what wakes me up in the morning.\\u201d\\n\\nHis road to ASU was far from straightforward.\\n\\n\\u201cI was denied from ASU at first,\\u201d he recalled. \\u201cIt was ego-shocking as a 17-year-old, but it made me work harder.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter appealing the decision and taking two prerequisite classes, he earned A\\u2019s in both and eventually graduated with honors.\\n\\n\\u201cBeing denied was a blessing in disguise,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt forced me to be more self-aware and disciplined.\\u201d\\n\\nRecognition for his accomplishments, he says, is nice but not the goal.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s just a pit stop \\u2014 like stopping at the gas station on the way to California,\\u201d he said with a laugh. \\u201cI\\u2019m grateful for the recognition, but this isn\\u2019t about me. It\\u2019s about my team and the people who believed in us.\\u201d\\n\\nWhen asked if he sees himself as successful, Xander paused.\\n\\n\\u201cMaybe once or twice a month I think, \\u2018good job,\\u2019\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut this is only chapter one.

Graphic created by Erika Gronek/ASU\\n\\nRecent headlines warn of cooling tech job postings and lower starting salaries, and stories are rife with fears that artificial intelligence, or AI, will eliminate entry-level roles.\\u00a0\\n\\nFor students considering a degree in computer science or software engineering, the news can sound discouraging.\\n\\nComputer scientists in the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at Arizona State University say the reality is more nuanced, complex and hopeful.\\u00a0\\n\\nThey point out that although tools and platforms evolve, the core skills of computer science remain valuable across industries. Those foundations have already survived major technological shifts, becoming more essential as industries adapted to new challenges.\\n\\nHere they explain more about what to know when it comes to the future of AI and jobs.\\n\\nRoss Maciejewski\\n\\nRoss Maciejewski, a professor of computer science and engineering and director of the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence, part of the Fulton Schools, leads one of the nation\\u2019s largest computer science programs and is internationally recognized for research in data visualization for homeland security, public health, social media and law enforcement.\\n\\nNadya Bliss\\n\\nNadya Bliss, executive director of ASU\\u2019s Global Security Initiative, a Fulton Schools computer science and engineering professor of practice, and chair of the Computing Community Consortium, part of the Computing Research Association, or CRA, is a leading computer scientist whose work advances national security and responsible innovation at the intersection of technology and society.\\n\\nSrividya Bansal\\n\\nSrividya Bansal, an associate professor and program chair of software engineering in the Fulton Schools, researches semantics-based approaches for big data integration and knowledge networks while leading efforts to prepare industry-ready graduates through innovative hands-on curricula.\\n\\nQuestion: Is AI eliminating computer science jobs?\\n\\nMaciejewski: Current reports don\\u2019t show a sweeping \\u201cAI effect.\\u201d Some studies suggest today\\u2019s slowdown could be the result of post-pandemic over-hiring. What\\u2019s definitely happening is a shift in how jobs are done. AI copilots can draft code, but that makes quality assurance, integration and systems thinking more important. Students who master those fundamentals can thrive.\\n\\nBliss: Computer science foundations, including abilities like problem-solving, abstraction and algorithmic thinking, don\\u2019t go out of style. Programming languages change, but core skills endure. My mantra is simple: Do more math. It makes you precise about assumptions and limitations, which is crucial in an AI-driven world.\\n\\nBansal: In software engineering, most effort is already in testing, debugging and maintenance. As Ross noted, AI can generate starter code, but students must still validate, integrate and secure it. Critical thinking and deep technical knowledge are more important than ever.\\n\\nQ: What historical patterns should students keep in mind?\\n\\nMaciejewski: Tech hiring has often been quite cyclical. The early \\u201990s, the 2001 dot-com crash and the 2008 recession all brought contractions, but the field rebounded with new platforms and opportunities. Students entering school today will likely graduate into a market that has absorbed AI more thoughtfully, with a continued demand for engineers who can design and scale trustworthy systems.\\n\\nBliss: Each major wave of technology, from parallel computing to internet commerce, reshaped the job market, but instead of eliminating roles, it created new and different ones. With every expansion, more fields became dependent on computer science expertise, multiplying opportunities rather than reducing them.\\n\\nBansal: We\\u2019ve seen similar cycles with software tools. In the 1980s, it was reusable code libraries, then open-source frameworks and later integrated development environments that eased syntax and debugging. Each time, people worried jobs might disappear. Instead, productivity increased, and engineers moved on to tackle bigger, more complex projects, like web and mobile apps in the 2000s. AI is the next wave in that same pattern. But it doesn\\u2019t eliminate the need for software engineers. It pushes them to higher levels of problem-solving.\\n\\nEvery industry is now a tech industry. No matter where you go, companies need people who can design, secure and maintain complex computer systems.\\n\\nQ: Where is job demand strongest right now?\\n\\nMaciejewski: Students with AI expertise are in demand, but shortages are also acute in cybersecurity and microelectronics. Globally, millions more cybersecurity professionals are needed, and the U.S. semiconductor industry alone may require nearly half a million additional workers by 2030. In the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence, every undergraduate takes a cybersecurity course, and we offer concentrations to prepare computer science students for these roles.\\n\\nBliss: In ASU\\u2019s Global Security Initiative, we\\u2019re also applying AI in mission-critical settings like defense and infrastructure. That\\u2019s where students learn both capability and responsibility: how AI can help, where it can fail and how to design around its limitations.\\n\\nQ: How is ASU preparing students for an AI-enabled future?\\n\\nMaciejewski: ASU ranks among the top programs nationally in AI education. Students take courses in robotics, machine learning and autonomous systems, but they can also gain applied experience through internships and research that connect AI to real-world challenges. The School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence is also the home of globally recognized faculty members such as data mining trailblazer Huan Liu and Subbarao Kambhampati, a past president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence and winner of the organization\\u2019s 2025 Patrick Henry Winston Outstanding Educator Award. We believe students have a real opportunity to engage with AI thought leaders here in the school.\\n\\nBansal: In software engineering, we focus on durable core skills like systems design, collaboration and resilience. Our capstone program is especially powerful. Industry sponsors bring real problems, and students carry projects from requirements through design, coding and testing. Increasingly, these projects are AI-enabled, involving recommendation engines, natural language processing or predictive analytics.\\n\\nThat means students practice treating AI as a tool, not a replacement. They learn to use it for code scaffolding or testing, but also to critique outputs, debug errors and integrate results into larger systems. Employers tell us this fluency, the ability to use AI while maintaining engineering rigor, is exactly what they need.\\n\\nBliss: That aligns with the results of the most recent Practitioner-to-Professor Survey from the CRA, where we asked industry experts to tell us what they were seeing out in the workplace. The feedback emphasized broad-based AI literacy, lifelong learning and cross-sector collaboration. ASU is built for that approach.\\n\\nQ: What skills matter most to employers?\\n\\nBliss: Problem-solving, systems thinking, experimentation and communication. Programming languages change, but fundamentals don\\u2019t. Employers also want teamwork, good soft skills and adaptability. These are things that can matter even more when you\\u2019re working alongside AI.\\n\\nMaciejewski: That\\u2019s why we encourage students to go beyond the classroom. Through research programs, service work and interdisciplinary projects, they practice leadership and collaboration. Employers increasingly ask, \\u201cWhat have you built? How did you work on a team? How did you test your system?\\u201d\\n\\nBansal: Capstone projects prepare students for exactly those questions. They practice client consultation, project management and public presentation, explaining technical decisions to both engineers and nontechnical stakeholders. By graduation, they\\u2019ve already delivered solutions to real clients, many involving AI, which shows employers they can apply skills in practice.\\n\\nQ: What about advanced degrees?\\n\\nBliss: The CRA worries that the U.S. risks losing its leadership position in fields like AI, cybersecurity and quantum computing because fewer domestic students are pursuing PhDs. Yet doctoral research powers innovation, industry growth and national security. Sustaining that pipeline requires partnerships. We need federal investment, as well as industry support, since most doctoral students ultimately go on to companies where they create new products, launch sectors and drive competitiveness. Advanced study also equips students to take on entirely new problems that simply can\\u2019t be addressed without deeper training.\\n\\nMaciejewski: For undergraduates, it\\u2019s natural to weigh immediate salaries against years of study. But advanced research puts you at the frontier, working on problems that can launch startups or reshape industries. At ASU, students also have opportunities to pursue accelerated master\\u2019s degrees, allowing them to deepen their expertise without adding many extra years of study. A graduate degree can open doors to more specialized roles and leadership positions in the workforce. A PhD isn\\u2019t for everyone, but for those who pursue it, the payoff comes not just in credentials but in the chance to create entirely new opportunities for themselves and others.\\n\\nThe road ahead contains both great challenges and great opportunities. This is a moment for us to lead.\\n\\nQ: What final advice would you give students?\\n\\nBansal: Approach your education with agility. Tools and platforms will keep changing, but what lasts are the habits you develop \\u2014 learning how to learn, sticking with things that don\\u2019t initially work and collaborating effectively. Those habits will allow you to grow into new opportunities as they appear.\\n\\nMaciejewski: When I graduated in 2001, the dot-com bubble had just burst and the job market looked bleak. What I learned is that cycles come and go, but the people who invest in key skills and stay adaptable are the ones who succeed over time. Don\\u2019t measure your future only by today\\u2019s headlines. Focus on building the kind of resilience and expertise that will carry you through shifts in technology and the economy alike.\\n\\nBliss: What excites me is that entirely new classes of challenges are emerging, and they create opportunities for computer scientists at every level. We\\u2019re grappling with the energy demands of large-scale computing and the need for low-power architectures. We\\u2019re exploring the intersections of AI with quantum computing and biotechnology. These are open problems, and they\\u2019re consequential ones. For students, that means there is enormous room to contribute and innovate. The future isn\\u2019t about fewer opportunities. It\\u2019s about different, more complex opportunities that require the kind of deep training college degrees can provide.\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nWhen it comes to organization, even cells have their own preferred system.While genetic engineers can design and assemble sophisticated gene circuits to program cells with new functions, as these\\u2026\\n\\nFrom his third-floor office at Arizona State University, floor-length windows give Sethuraman Panchanathan a stunning panorama of the sprawling Tempe campus.But the view is not new to\\u00a0\\u2026\\n\\nToday, there are approximately 14,000 active satellites in orbit around Earth.
